  <description>&lt;span&gt;Enter Now: Create an Obesity Prevention Game&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Join the Office on Women's Health in helping women and girls reach and maintain a healthy weight. Enter our &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://challenge.gov/a/buzz/challenge/985/ideas/top" title="Shape of Health: An Obesity Prevention Game – Challenge"&gt;Shape of Health: An Obesity Prevention Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; challenge by creating a video game focused on obesity prevention or weight control for women or girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Image of a woman holding a smartphone." src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-shape-of-health.jpg" style="float: right; width: 350px; height: 233px;" /&gt;In the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/healthy-weight/weight-and-obesity"&gt;2 out of every 3 women&lt;/a&gt; have overweight or obesity. Among girls 2 to 19 years old, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity_child_15_16/obesity_child_15_16.htm" title="Health E-Stats - Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity Among Children and Adolescents Aged 2–19 Years: United States, 1963–1965 Through 2013–2014"&gt;2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt; found that about 1 in 3 girls has either overweight or obesity. Now is the time to give women and girls the tools they need to lead healthier lives, as extra weight can lead to conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and many cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
Through our &lt;em&gt;Shape of Health: An Obesity Prevention Game&lt;/em&gt; challenge, you have the opportunity to create an engaging web- or mobile-based game that helps women or girls build healthier exercise and eating habits to prevent obesity. If you have an idea, we want to hear from you! All participants must submit their entries by 11:59 p.m. ET on April 7.

  <title>Your Family’s Health Is Your Health</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/family-heart-health-history</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Your Family’s Health Is Your Health&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;“How could this happen to me?”&lt;/p&gt;
This is what one of my colleagues says her mother kept saying after she found out she had &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/heart-disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nicole Greene" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-nicole-greene-headshot.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;Jane* thought she’d done everything right. Before she was diagnosed at 67, she felt like she was in the best shape of her life. She exercised daily, chose mostly healthy foods, didn’t drink or smoke, and kept her cholesterol and blood pressure under control. She felt great — until Jane experienced an unusual pressure in her chest while hiking. One of her friends had recently passed away from a heart attack, so Jane took it seriously. Luckily, so did her doctor. A series of tests found serious blockages in Jane’s &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/glossary/#arteries"&gt;arteries&lt;/a&gt;. She needed &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002950.htm" title="Open heart surgery: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia"&gt;heart surgery&lt;/a&gt;, so she underwent a triple bypass a little more than three months after that first feeling of chest pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
Jane’s diagnosis prompted most of her five siblings to see a health professional to determine their risk. Jane’s brother Tim, who had some shortness of breath, received a similar diagnosis. He also needed heart surgery and had it around the same time as Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
While both Jane and Tim are on their way to a full recovery, they and their families were caught off guard. They didn’t think they were at risk of heart disease. They both led generally healthy lives and hadn’t heard of any family history. But after their diagnoses, they learned for the first time that two of their uncles had heart disease in their 70s and 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
I wanted to share this story because it’s Family Health History Month. It’s a time to talk with your relatives about the health of your family tree. After all, if you have a close family member with a chronic disease like heart disease, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/stroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/famhistory/famhist_basics.htm" title="Basics|Family History|Genomics|CDC"&gt;you may be more likely to develop that disease yourself&lt;/a&gt;. Family history is also important if you’re planning to become pregnant. You’ll want to know whether there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/famhistory/famhist_plan_pregnancy.htm" title="Planning Pregnancy|Family History|Genomics|CDC"&gt;family history of conditions&lt;/a&gt; like birth defects and development disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
Since it’s something you can’t control, recognizing the role that your family’s health history plays in your life may feel a little scary. But knowing your family health history allows you to be proactive by reducing your risk in ways you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; control and watching for certain signs and symptoms that something might be wrong. For example, if your doctor or nurse knows that certain health issues run in your family, they can recommend smart lifestyle changes to help lower your risk. These changes might include &lt;a href="https://women.smokefree.gov/" title="Smokefree Women"&gt;quitting smoking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/healthy-eating"&gt;making healthier foods choices&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/getting-active"&gt;getting more physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. Your doctor or nurse might also recommend certain screening tests that can help catch problems early, when they are often easier to treat. But they can’t make those kinds of personalized recommendations if you don’t know your family health history.&lt;/p&gt;
The best way to understand your family health history is to talk about it with your relatives, and what better time to do that than when you’re together for the holidays? We’re here to help you prepare and collect the information you need. Try these tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with what you know. &lt;/strong&gt;Make a list of your blood relatives. That means starting with your parents, siblings, and any children you have. Then move on to your extended family, like grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and half-siblings. Once you have your list, write down any diseases and conditions you already know about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="rteindent1"&gt;If you’re adopted, you can ask your adoptive partners whether they have any medical information about your birth parents. The adoption agency also may have information available. If you have a relationship with your birth parents, you can ask them directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to your family. &lt;/strong&gt;Chat with your relatives about what they know about your family’s health history. If they don’t already know, tell them why it’s an important tool you can all use to protect your health. Ask them what they know about any relatives who have passed away. Then share with them the history you’ve compiled and ask them whether anything is missing. Some families talk well together in groups, reminding each other of relatives and illnesses they might have forgotten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask the right questions. &lt;/strong&gt;You want to know whether your relatives have any chronic diseases or conditions and if they know of any in the family (past and present). Remember, high blood pressure and cholesterol count as conditions you want to track. You also want to ask them how old they or your relatives were when they were diagnosed. Lastly, if you don’t know, ask about your family’s ancestry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organize and save your information. &lt;/strong&gt;You can organize and update your family health history information using free online tools. &lt;a href="https://phgkb.cdc.gov/FHH/html/index.html" title="My Family Health Portrait|Public Health Genomics Knowledge Base"&gt;My Family Health Portrait&lt;/a&gt; is easy to use and allows you to enter your family health history, share it with your relatives, and update it over time. The best part is that you can print it to bring to your next checkup. This will help your doctor or nurse make recommendations to help you stay healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;I know it might feel like this is just one more thing you need to do during an already busy time of year, but it can also be an opportunity to connect with your family. Health may not be something you talk about often, so you might cover new ground or discover something new (and have a chance to reminisce) about a departed loved one. Take your time and enjoy what I hope will be a rewarding journey. When you know your health history, your whole family benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>4 Things Women Need to Know About Stroke</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/things-know-about-stroke</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;4 Things Women Need to Know About Stroke&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Stroke happens to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/stroke"&gt;1 in 5 women&lt;/a&gt;. In the United States, someone has a stroke every 40 seconds. This is unfortunate because most strokes are preventable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Dr. Cheryl Bushnell" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-cheryl-bushnell-full.jpg" style="float: right; width: 350px; height: 367px;" /&gt;Stroke happens when blood flow to the brain stops or is blocked, which causes brain cells to die. There are two types of stroke: One is caused by a blood clot, and the other happens when a blood vessel breaks and causes bleeding in the brain. The brain is complex, so not all strokes look alike, but symptoms can come on suddenly. Stroke is a serious health concern for women and can happen to anyone, at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
Here are four things every woman should know about stroke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women have unique risk factors for stroke. &lt;/strong&gt;Major risk factors for stroke, such as having high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, can happen to anyone. But women have &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/stroke/stroke-risk-factors"&gt;unique risk factors for stroke&lt;/a&gt;, including:  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul class="rteindent1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/pregnancy-complications"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;problems during pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as preeclampsia or high blood pressure. These complications can increase the risk of stroke for many years, even beyond childbearing years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoking cigarettes while taking combination &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/birth-control-methods"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;birth control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (birth control that has both estrogen and progesterone). Women 35 and older who smoke and use this type of birth control are at especially high risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking hormone replacement therapy&lt;/strong&gt; that contains estrogen plus progesterone. Ask your doctor if you can safely take these medicines to ease &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menopause/menopause-symptoms-and-relief"&gt;menopause symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, such as hot flashes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/migraine"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;migraines with aura&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or migraines that start with visual symptoms before the headache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having atrial fibrillation&lt;/strong&gt; (Afib), a type of irregular heart beat that can cause blood clots to form in the heart. This is more common in women, especially in women older than 75. It is important to know if you have Afib so your doctor can give you medicine to prevent blood clots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can learn the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/stroke/stroke-symptoms"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;common symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; of stroke with the F.A.S.T. test: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul class="rteindent1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;ace: Is one side of the person’s face drooping?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;rm weakness: Is one arm weak or numb? Try lifting the person’s arms to see if one drifts down or cannot be lifted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;peech: Is she having trouble speaking, such as slurring words, or is she not able to get the right words out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ime: Call 911 right away if someone is experiencing any of these symptoms! Every minute counts when it comes to your brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="rteindent1"&gt;Other common symptoms include numbness and tingling on one side of the body; vision loss or trouble seeing; severe dizziness, vertigo, or loss of balance; or sudden severe headache. Women are also more likely to have unique symptoms that can slow down or delay a stroke diagnosis, such as difficulty thinking straight or being excessively sleepy. When these symptoms happen, even when common stroke symptoms are also present, doctors and emergency providers might not think of stroke right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acting quickly during a stroke improves chances of survival and making a full recovery. &lt;/strong&gt;F.A.S.T. is not just an acronym; it’s also an important action: &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/stroke/how-survive-stroke"&gt;Act F.A.S.T.&lt;/a&gt; when a stroke happens because treatments need to happen right away. Call 911 if you think you are or someone near you is having a stroke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="rteindent1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not&lt;/strong&gt; go to sleep to see if the symptoms improve, drive yourself to the hospital or have someone else drive you, or call your doctor’s office. All of these actions can delay needed stroke treatment. Just call 911 right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can take steps to prevent stroke. &lt;/strong&gt;The best way to treat stroke is to prevent it from happening in the first place! Here’s what you can do to lead a healthy life and prevent stroke:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul class="rteindent1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/healthy-weight"&gt;healthy weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/getting-active"&gt;Exercise&lt;/a&gt; for 30 minutes a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make healthy food choices most of the time. Learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/healthy-eating"&gt;healthy eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/stroke/stroke-prevention#4"&gt;numbers&lt;/a&gt;, including blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol levels. These numbers are clues about your risk of stroke. Talk to your doctor about your numbers and what they should be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t smoke. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;Most strokes are preventable and treatable, and preventing stroke starts with knowledge! Talk to your doctor about your unique risks and what steps you can take to lower your risk. Learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/stroke"&gt;stroke and how stroke affects women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Kidney Disease: What You Need to Know</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/spotlight-kidney-health</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Kidney Disease: What You Need to Know&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Did you know that March is National Kidney Month? It’s a time to talk about kidney health and chronic kidney disease, a common disease among adults in the United States. That’s why we asked Dr. Kajal Patel, a doctor who specializes in kidney care and disease treatment, to share how women can keep their kidneys healthy and what they need to know about chronic kidney disease. Get her tips for kidney health and learn about women’s unique risk factors for kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;March 22, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What do our kidneys do?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Most of us have two functioning kidneys. They perform important jobs to keep our bodies working as they should, including filtering our blood to remove extra waste and fluid to make urine.&lt;/p&gt;
Our kidneys also help control our blood pressure, make red blood cells, and keep our bones healthy. If a person has kidney disease, their kidneys may not be able to perform these duties as well or at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What steps can women take to keep their kidneys healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;You can take steps to keep your kidneys healthy by leading an overall healthy life. That means eating well, exercising regularly, managing your stress, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking or quitting smoking, limiting your alcohol, and getting plenty of sleep. I also encourage you to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know the risks of kidney disease. Women who have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure are more likely to develop kidney disease. It’s important to talk to your doctor about managing any of these risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See a doctor or nurse right away if you develop a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/urinary-tract-infections" title="Urinary tract infections"&gt;urinary tract infection (UTI)&lt;/a&gt; so that they prescribe you an antibiotic to treat it. An untreated UTI can hurt your kidneys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a conversation with your doctor or nurse about kidney health at your next checkup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What is chronic kidney disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means your kidneys are damaged and they can’t filter your blood the way healthy kidneys can. There are different causes and stages of CKD, so if you are diagnosed with CKD, it’s important to work with your doctor to help you figure out the cause and come up with the right treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Are some women more likely to get chronic kidney disease than others?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Some people are more likely to get CKD than others. For example, kidney disease is more common in African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, people over 60, and people with a family history of kidney failure. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the leading causes of kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
However, we know there are some interesting reasons why women may develop CKD. Pregnancy can cause acute kidney injury (AKI), or the sudden loss of kidney function. High blood pressure and obesity in women during the years when they can have children increases the risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/glossary#preeclampsia"&gt;preeclampsia&lt;/a&gt; in pregnancy, which can lead to AKI. Women who have AKI and preeclampsia during pregnancy are at higher risk of high blood pressure and CKD later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
Additionally, autoimmune diseases like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/lupus" title="Lupus"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to affect women and can damage organs, including the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Are there steps women can take to manage chronic kidney disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Yes. For starters, finding a doctor who you trust and have a good relationship with is key to navigating life with CKD. You can work together to come up with a plan to treat your kidney disease before it leads to kidney failure (which is when your kidneys have lost most of their ability to function). Your plan may include taking medicines and managing any other conditions or diseases you’re living with, such as high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
You will also want to take steps to lead an overall healthy life, such as making &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/healthy-eating" title="Healthy Eating"&gt;healthy food choices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/stress-and-your-health" title="Stress and your health"&gt;managing stress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/getting-active" title="Getting Active"&gt;getting plenty of exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What role does nutrition play in kidney disease management?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;For women with kidney disease, it’s really important to work with your doctor and/or a dietitian to make a healthy eating plan that’s right for you. Making changes to what you eat can help keep kidney disease from getting worse. You may need to keep a close eye on the amounts of protein, salt, and important minerals in your diet. If your kidneys don’t work well, for example, too much sodium can cause fluid buildup in your body and high blood pressure, which strains your heart. You also want to watch out for potassium: Kidney disease may raise levels of the mineral in your blood, which is known as hyperkalemia. This can cause serious problems, including heart issues. In addition to taking medicine that treats hyperkalemia, women may need to cut back on foods that are high in potassium, like bananas and sweet potatoes. I know this sounds like the opposite of what most people learn about certain nutrients. That’s why it’s so important to work with an expert who can help you learn what you should eat and drink to manage kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What should women ask their doctors to learn about their risk of chronic kidney disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Ask your doctor if your risk of kidney disease is higher than normal. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart or blood vessel problems, ask whether you need to be tested for kidney disease. The only way to know whether you have kidney disease for sure is to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;
Most women will not have severe symptoms in the early stages of kidney disease. But do let your doctor know if you start noticing some of these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trouble thinking clearly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor appetite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trouble sleeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry, itchy skin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swollen feet or ankles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to urinate more often, especially at night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>An Interview About Heart Health</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/heart-health-spotlight</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;An Interview About Heart Health&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of American women, and stroke is fourth? The good news is there are steps you can take to lower your risk of heart disease and stroke at any age. We spoke to Dr. Rachel Dreyer, an Assistant Professor at the Yale School of Medicine who specializes in cardiovascular outcomes research with a focus on women’s health. Dr. Dreyer shares the basics you need to know about heart disease and how to keep your heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;March 2, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What steps can women take for good heart health?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;There are several ways that women can help control their risk of heart disease, or, in other words, there are steps women can follow for good heart health. The American Heart Association calls them “Life’s Simple 7.” These seven steps include staying physically active, controlling levels of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/heart-disease/heart-disease-prevention#4" title="Steps women can take to prevent heart disease"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, following a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/heart-healthy-eating" title="Heart-healthy eating"&gt;heart-healthy eating plan&lt;/a&gt;, managing blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing blood sugar, and quitting smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Are there risk factors for heart disease that are out of women’s control?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Yes, there are some risk factors for heart disease that women can’t change, such as age, sex, heredity (family health history), and race or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;How can women work with their doctors to figure out their risk for heart disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Schedule a visit with your doctor to discuss your risk factors and learn more about your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/heart-disease/heart-disease-prevention#4" title="Steps women can take to prevent heart disease"&gt;heart disease numbers&lt;/a&gt; to assess your risk of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What are the heart disease numbers women need to know for good heart health? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;There are several key numbers to know, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total blood cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a waxy, fatty substance in the blood. When too much cholesterol builds up on the walls of the blood vessels, it makes it very difficult for the heart to pump blood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; or low-density lipoprotein, often called “bad” cholesterol. Bad cholesterol can cause plaque to build up, which can lead to heart disease and stroke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDL cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; or high-density lipoprotein, often called “good” cholesterol. It can help eliminate bad cholesterol from your blood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood pressure, &lt;/strong&gt;which is essentially the pressure the blood puts on the arteries as the heart beats and relaxes. Blood pressure varies depending on exercise, stress, and sleep levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; or the amount of sugar present in the bloodstream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body mass index&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. This varies depending on age, gender, and build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;To know what your numbers should be, you need to talk with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Why are these numbers important, and what steps can women take to improve them?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Knowing these numbers and the risk factors associated with heart disease can help you to take control of your health and seek advice from your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
You can control or treat some risk factors with lifestyle changes (Remember: “Life’s Simple 7.”). Your doctor may also recommend certain medicines, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
One of the best things women can do for good heart health is quit smoking. Nicotine addiction is very powerful. Women should talk to their doctors about coming up with a quit plan. They can also call the &lt;a href="https://smokefree.gov/tools-tips/speak-expert" title="Speak to an expert"&gt;smoking quitline&lt;/a&gt; at 1-800-QUIT-NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What are some small heart-healthy eating changes women can make?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I have eight tips!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat more fruit and vegetables, and aim for variety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat more whole-grain foods, including whole-wheat bread, rye bread, and brown rice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use olive, canola, or corn oil when cooking, and limit your saturated fats. You find saturated fat in foods like pizza, ice cream, and fried chicken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat more lean proteins, such as skinless poultry, fish, and vegetable protein like legumes and lentils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read food labels to make healthy food choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit sodium intake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut down on sugar-sweetened drinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat plenty of calcium-rich foods, such as dairy products and dark leafy greens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;When it comes to exercise and heart health, what should women know?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/fitness-and-nutrition/how-be-active-health" title="How to be active for health"&gt;Staying physically active&lt;/a&gt; can increase your length and quality of life and help reduce the risk of heart disease. It also leads to an overall reduction in blood pressure and can boost levels of good cholesterol. You should try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity each day, such as brisk walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What about stress?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Stress, particularly chronic stress, can negatively affect your health. It not only causes issues related to heart health, but it can also lead to uncomfortable physical symptoms like headaches and stomach problems. A stressful event causes the body to react and release a hormone, adrenaline, which speeds up your heart rate and breathing and briefly raises your blood pressure. It’s often called the “fight or flight” response. Chronic stress means that your body is in this state for days and even weeks on end, leading to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. This may damage artery walls.&lt;/p&gt;
Stress may be particularly relevant to women who previously had a heart attack. A heart attack is a life-threatening and unpredictable event, which causes serious amounts of stress during and after the event. Women who have experienced a heart attack often report feeling a lack of control, uncertainty, and helplessness. This resulting psychological stress may not only affect women’s emotional well-being, but it also negatively affects their cardiac health and recovery after the heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;
There are ways to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/stress-and-your-health" title="Stress and your health"&gt;manage stress&lt;/a&gt;. You can try exercising, maintaining a positive attitude, quitting smoking, and eating well. You also can try relaxation or stress management techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;If you could tell women one thing about heart health, what would it be?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Know your numbers and &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; your numbers. Discuss your risk factors with your doctor, and take action around the risk factors that can be controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Is there anything else you’d like to share?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Like eating well and exercising, getting plenty of sleep can help you achieve your best for your family and career, and it can improve your well-being for years to come. Sleep health is a fundamental requirement of life — it’s not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Barbra Streisand and Vivek Murthy: How We Can Help Save Women's Lives</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Barbra Streisand and Vivek Murthy: How We Can Help Save Women's Lives&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ed. note: This blog is cross-posted from TIME. The original post date was February 22, 2016. &lt;a href="http://time.com/4230970/barbra-streisand-vivek-murthy-heart-health/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog-Blog', 'http://time.com/4230970/barbra-streisand-vivek-murthy-heart-health/'); return false;" target="_blank" title="Barbra Streisand and Vivek Murthy: How to Save Women's Lives | TIME"&gt;Read the original post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="Barbra Streisand and Vivek Murthy" class="alignright" height="606" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2016/02/barbra-streisand-vivek-murthy-post.jpg" width="450" /&gt;Dr. Vivek Murthy is the U.S. Surgeon General and an internal medicine physician. Barbra Streisand is an award-winning singer, songwriter, actress, and filmmaker, and co-founder of the Women's Heart Alliance with Ronald O. Perelman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Too many women are dying from a largely preventable disease.&lt;/h2&gt;
Imagine a person having a heart attack. If you're like most people, you probably pictured a man. Yet cardiovascular disease kills one woman in America nearly every 90 seconds, close to &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf'); return false;" target="_blank" title="National Vital Statistics Reports, Volume 64, Number 2, 02/16/2016"&gt;400,000 women&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 10 MB) each year. It's the number one threat to life women face, killing more women than all cancers &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db229.pdf" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db229.pdf'); return false;" target="_blank" title="NCHS Data Brief, Number 229, December 2015"&gt;combined&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 712 KB). Part of the reason this killer is so effective is that most women don't even realize it's there.&lt;/p&gt;
Not even our own mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
Diane Streisand Kind worked in the New York City school system, helped many charitable causes, and passed her beautiful singing voice down to her daughter. At the age of 81, she got sick and needed bypass surgery to save her life.&lt;/p&gt;
Myetraie Murthy came to this country with her husband and two small children and ran her husband's family medicine clinic. Yet, even though her father died of a heart attack and her mother had a stroke in her 60s, Myetraie has always focused on the health of her family, friends, and neighbors — not her own.&lt;/p&gt;
Ninety percent of women have one or more risk factors for heart disease or stroke, yet, like our mothers, they too often go unaware of the threat for too long. And as a result, too many women are suffering and dying from a &lt;a href="http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1909605" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1909605'); return false;" target="_blank" title="American College of Cardiology Foundation | Journal of the American College of Cardiology | Low-Risk Diet and Lifestyle Habits in the Primary Prevention of Myocardial Infarction in MenA Population-Based Prospective Cohort Study"&gt;largely preventable disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
If we want to save more women's lives, we have to change what we do, as individuals and as a society, so that women understand their risk and can get the help they need. That is why we are marking &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/features/heartmonth/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/features/heartmonth/'); return false;" target="_blank" title="Strong Men Put Their Heart Health First | Features | CDC"&gt;American Heart Month&lt;/a&gt; by asking all Americans to join in combating this quiet epidemic — for themselves and for the women they love. Here's what you should know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1. It's important to recognize the symptoms of heart disease and get help quickly.&lt;/strong&gt; This is especially important since heart attacks in women can present in less-obvious ways. While chest pain or discomfort is still the most common symptom of a heart attack, women are more likely than men to have atypical symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, and back, shoulder, or jaw pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2. Women can lower their own risk of heart disease proactively.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.localheart.org/idc/groups/branding-public/@wcm/@cmc/documents/downloadable/ucm_468266.pdf" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.localheart.org/idc/groups/branding-public/@wcm/@cmc/documents/downloadable/ucm_468266.pdf'); return false;" target="_blank" title="GO RED FOR WOMEN® 2015 FACT SHEET"&gt;80% of heart disease and strokes&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 88 KB) can be prevented by lifestyle changes and education. It starts by eating a nutritious and balanced diet. A good diet is a critical part of heart health and will help you have more energy and feel better. If you'd like tips about what to eat, you can go to &lt;a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.choosemyplate.gov/'); return false;" target="_blank" title="Choose MyPlate"&gt;choosemyplate.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
Be active. An average of &lt;a href="http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/early/2013/04/04/ATVBAHA.112.300878.abstract" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/early/2013/04/04/ATVBAHA.112.300878.abstract'); return false;" target="_blank" title="Walking Versus Running for Hypertension, Cholesterol, and Diabetes Mellitus Risk Reduction"&gt;22 minutes of brisk walking a day&lt;/a&gt; can significantly reduce your risk of heart disease and dying early. We know it never feels like there are enough hours in the day, but a small amount of activity can make a big difference. Better yet, do it with your family or friends.&lt;/p&gt;
If you're a smoker, seek help to quit. There's nothing more effective. Within one year of quitting, your risk of coronary heart disease is &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53017/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53017/'); return false;" target="_blank" title="How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease: The Biology and Behavioral Basis for Smoking-Attributable Disease - NCBI Bookshelf"&gt;cut in half&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
And make sure to visit your doctor to get screened and assess your unique risk for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Safeguarding women's heart health is not something individuals can do alone.&lt;/strong&gt; It will take women and men, families, and communities coming together to make structural changes that will help lower the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
We must ensure that our neighborhoods have a grocery store or a farmer's market where we can get fresh fruits and vegetables at affordable prices. We must work to build sidewalks and playgrounds in our communities so we can take walks and play outside with our children without fearing for our safety. And we must continue to use our voices to call for equitable medical research — because today only &lt;a href="http://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/content/3/2/135.long" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/content/3/2/135.long'); return false;" target="_blank" title="Representation of Women in Randomized Clinical Trials of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention"&gt;one third of research participants&lt;/a&gt; in heart studies are women.&lt;/p&gt;
These are changes we can only make together. Getting healthy and building communities that support health are much easier tasks to achieve when we are pursuing them hand-in-hand with the people around us.&lt;/p&gt;
Just as our mothers have been incredibly important in both our lives, women have long been the backbone of our families and our nation. The history of our country has seen the steady — and often too slow — march toward equality and fair treatment for women. Advancing cardiovascular health for women will be an important step in that journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>"My Cardiologist Says I'm a Miracle"</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/cardiologist-says-miracle</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;"My Cardiologist Says I'm a Miracle"&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="A doctor holding a heart" class="alignright" height="300" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2016/02/cardiologist-says-miracle-post.jpg" width="450" /&gt;Heart disease was never something I worried about. I know it's the number one killer of women, but I've always done everything "right." I exercise regularly. I maintain a healthy weight. My numbers are good, so I don't have high cholesterol or hypertension. But I do have one risk factor — my father has a history of coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
Despite being generally healthy, less than a year ago, I found out that I had a 99% blockage in my left anterior descending coronary artery. They call that artery "the widow maker." It's the largest coronary artery, and a blockage can cause sudden cardiac death syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
Before my diagnosis, I started experiencing symptoms while exercising. I felt a burning in the back of my throat, like I ate too many jalapenos. For a while, it only happened while I was running. But it got progressively worse until it started happening when I would walk up just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; flight of stairs. I knew something was wrong; this wasn't normal for me. I went to my primary care doctor, who thought it was gastric reflux disease and gave me medication. The medication didn't work. I kept experiencing the same symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
I decided to go to an urgent care center nearby. I knew something was off. I just didn't feel right. They did an electrocardiogram (or EKG), and it was normal. However, the physician's assistant asked me to do her a favor. She asked me not to run over the weekend and to go see her friend, a cardiologist, the following Monday. I was concerned, but I just kept trying to rationalize it. I told myself, "You're only 51, you're a woman, your cholesterol has always been normal, you're not overweight, and you exercise regularly!"&lt;/p&gt;
I'm so thankful she gave me that advice. I went to see the cardiologist she recommended. He took my full history and did all the usual lab work. Everything was normal, but he was still concerned. He decided to give me a stress test. The stress test showed some small EKG changes when my heart rate went above 150. He also found some abnormal wall motion in my heart at the same heart rate. He scheduled a cardiac catheterization, a special x-ray of the heart, for the next day. During the procedure, they found the 99% blockage in my left anterior descending coronary artery and placed a stent in my heart immediately. I remember thinking, "What? Me? A blockage? A stent?" It didn't seem possible, but it was! Following the procedure, I went to cardiac rehab. It felt a little strange being the only woman in the room, as well as the youngest person.&lt;/p&gt;
It's been over six months since the procedure. I don't experience burning in my throat anymore, but I do have a lot of thankfulness. It's been sobering, too. I'm only 51. I had pretty minor symptoms that were initially written off as heartburn. Yet, I had a serious blockage in the biggest artery in my heart, and I survived. I'm a survivor — that's certainly sobering.&lt;/p&gt;
My cardiologist says I'm a miracle. He says I survived because I listened to my body and kept trying to find an answer. I encourage every other woman to do the same thing. Trust yourself and listen to your body. If something doesn't feel right, don't stop until you get an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
After such an experience, I think we become more aware of what's going on in our lives, versus just going through the motions. I haven't really had to make any lifestyle changes, which seems a bit odd, but I was already eating healthfully and exercising. The one thing that I am working harder to control is stress. I find myself taking everything a little more lightly, worrying less, and saying "no" more often so I can spend time with my family, which has definitely become a huge priority in my life. I have an 11-year-old daughter and find joy in everything she does! I hope to be around for her for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Eating for Your Health and Your Heart</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/eating-health-and-heart</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Eating for Your Health and Your Heart&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Karen B. DeSalvo" class="alignright" height="450" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2016/02/eating-for-health-and-heart-post.jpg" width="360" /&gt;I can admit it: I love food.&lt;/p&gt;
In New Orleans — my hometown — food is serious business.&lt;/p&gt;
Gumbo? Yes, please.&lt;/p&gt;
Doberge cake? You have no idea what you are missing.&lt;/p&gt;
But my mother taught me a long time ago that what you put into your body, and how much, matters. As a doctor, I know that science has proved her right: Eating healthy and being physically active reduces your risk of heart disease and other chronic diseases and improves overall quality of life. So it all comes down to balance. If I want to indulge in treats like Doberge, I need to balance it by increasing my activity, which for me is running.&lt;/p&gt;
Luckily, the &lt;a href="http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/'); return false;" title="2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines - health.gov"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2015—2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is full of recommendations that can help you choose and stick with the kind of healthy eating pattern that will lead to a better, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;
Here is the good news: Eating healthy is not a rigid prescription. Instead, you should choose what to eat from a variety of vegetables, fruits, grains, low–fat and fat–free dairy, lean meats, and other proteins while working to limit foods that are high in saturated fats, &lt;em&gt;trans&lt;/em&gt; fats, added sugars, and sodium.&lt;/p&gt;
How can we make that goal a reality? Here is what I recommend to patients: Focus on making &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; shifts so that eating healthy becomes more manageable. Over the course of a week, a day, or even a meal, these small shifts can end up making a big difference. &lt;/p&gt;
Change is hard. So I thought I would share my top five tips for small shifts that can make a big difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim to cook and prepare food at home for as many meals as possible. Restaurant and processed foods are often high in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore ways to make meals healthier by adding more vegetables or reducing the amount of sodium added through sauces and dressings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write it down. Keep notes of what you are eating (the good, the bad, and the ugly) and especially how you are feeling when you eat those foods. When you write down how you feel after eating or drinking something fatty or sugary, you might be less likely to do it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink plenty of water. No need to add extra sugar and calories through your beverage choices. You can add a slice of fruit to your water for a quick boost of color and flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for ways to add in small amounts of physical activity every day. For many of us, it can be hard to carve out a large chunk of time each day. So I tell my patients to aim for 150 minutes per week by adding a walk or wheelchair roll during lunch or meetings and incorporating physical activity into time spent with family and friends. And if you are able, take the stairs every opportunity you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Want to learn more? &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kwG68fYQ3w&amp;list=PLrl7E8KABz1Gc_evtQRdYSe7AhSs5H4_V&amp;index=5" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kwG68fYQ3w&amp;list=PLrl7E8KABz1Gc_evtQRdYSe7AhSs5H4_V&amp;index=5'); return false;" title="Dietary Guidelines for Americans: How to Make Healthy Shifts - YouTube"&gt;Watch this video&lt;/a&gt; for more tips and examples of what you can do to get healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
I know you can do it. And if it helps, know I will be eating healthy right alongside you. Just try not to ask about the occasional New Orleans food splurge.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Caregiving Changed Me: One Daughter's Story</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/caregiving-changed-me</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Caregiving Changed Me: One Daughter's Story&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Carol and her mom." class="alignright" height="508" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2015/12/caregiving-changed-me-post1.jpg" width="400" /&gt;Agreed denial. That was our little dance — my mother and me — when it came to her health concerns. Her Parkinson's started with a pinky tremor. My adoptive mother — 50 years older than me, widowed, and fiercely independent — was determined to live alone. Then came heart disease, and the Parkinson's got worse. I was preoccupied. I was in my late 30s, married, raising three daughters, the founder and director of a private school in an Atlanta suburb, and my husband worked in another city only coming home every other weekend. Juggling all of my responsibilities usually came down to who needed me the most at any given moment. I worried about my mother all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
I started noticing bruises on her arms and legs. Was Mama falling and not telling me? She grew paranoid, claiming someone was trying to get in her house. She crashed into her neighbor's mailbox and got lost going to the store. She looked gaunt and made excuses about forgetting to put the food away after eating or not remembering a cousin's name. I patched together a rotating schedule of caring neighbors, willing church members, extended family, home health aides, but I knew it was time. She needed to be with me — with us — her family.&lt;/p&gt;
People asked if we were close when I mentioned we were &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; moving in together — kids, pets, my mom, two households. I'd smile back and reply, "What's close got to do with it? Do we always get along? Hell no. Will I take care of my mother? Hell yes."&lt;/p&gt;
From the day we moved in together, I knew that my mother was much worse than I had allowed myself to see. She froze at doorways and couldn't manage her own basic hygiene. Most of her days were acts of sheer nonsensical repetition. Something else was going on. I knew it before it was diagnosed — dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
Mother spiraled. She wandered at night, confused and agitated. She stared into the faces of her family, "Who are these people?" I learned the name for this the hard way — sundowning. She started referring to me as "Little Girl." I asked my family to forego my 40th birthday. I couldn't blow out candles and look into the face of my mother knowing she did not know who I was. I asked my heart, "Who am I if not my mother's daughter?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Carol O'Dell" class="alignright" height="302" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2015/12/caregiving-changed-me-post2.jpg" width="350" /&gt;I floundered. We floundered. My children and my marriage suffered. I withdrew, snapping at anyone who came near. I was beyond scared. I didn't know how to do this. Would I have to break that vow? Was my mother beyond my care?&lt;/p&gt;
And then it changed. One ordinary day I looked at my mother who no longer knew me and resolved, "You might not remember me, but I remember. I remember you. I remember us. I will tell our stories."&lt;/p&gt;
Caregiving changed me. I did not and could not go back to the person I was before. I am someone different. I have new plans and new dreams. I am not who I was, and I am not who I will be.&lt;/p&gt;
I've learned to pace myself. I've learned that guilt, anger, resentment, and frustration will eat you alive. It's easy to get caught up in the drama and trauma at hand. If you pour yourself into those you love without taking the time to sleep, laugh, walk, call a friend, vent, or do simple things like read a magazine or watch the birds outside your window, you'll find that you're empty and have nothing left to give anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
I've learned to be a strong advocate for those I love. I've learned to ask for and insist on the community support my family needs because doing it solo is just plain stupid. I've learned that our elders, children, and the poor and marginalized need us to be their voice.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>&lt;span&gt;2 Words, 2 Years, 5 Posts You Need to Read&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women's health.&lt;/em&gt; Two words, so many topics. Of course, everyone is passionate about different issues. That's why we try to discuss many subjects on the OWH Blog, often through the voice of a woman who has a deep and personal connection to that topic. It's been two years since we launched our blog, and to celebrate our anniversary, I want to share five of my favorite posts and why I think every woman should read them.&lt;/p&gt;

But then he quickly, often without you noticing, gets possessive and controlling," writes Leslie Morgan Steiner, a domestic violence survivor and author. Leslie shares the things she wished she'd known before she started dating her abusive ex–husband, reminding us that interpersonal violence can happen to anyone and it's never the victim's fault.&lt;/p&gt;

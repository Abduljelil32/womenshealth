  <title>Catch Up to Get Ahead: The Role of Healthcare Providers in Getting Children Up-to-Date on Vaccines </title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Catch Up to Get Ahead: The Role of Healthcare Providers in Getting Children Up-to-Date on Vaccines &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Vaccinations are more important than ever this year because of the disrupting impact that COVID-19 has had on the nation’s routinely recommended vaccination schedule. As we recognize National Immunization Awareness Month in August, protecting individuals and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) is vital to keeping children healthy, preventing VPD outbreaks, and reducing the burden of infectious diseases. Healthcare providers are key to this by emphasizing the importance of immunizations when communicating with your patients’ parents and caregivers, as well as by bringing your patients up-to-date on all their routinely recommended vaccinations. Together we can &lt;a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/catch-up"&gt;&lt;em&gt;catch up to get ahead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;
We truly thank healthcare providers for being on the front-lines while continuing to care for your patients during this pandemic. As pediatricians, we understand how busy you are. During this time, we want to encourage our enhanced collective efforts to help mitigate the continuing impact of COVID-19 on the national rates of childhood immunizations now, before the influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses begin co-circulating.&lt;/p&gt;
We encourage providers to work with your practices to help identify children who missed a recommended vaccination and contact their parents or caregivers. When speaking with parents and caregivers, remind them of the importance of catching up with vaccinations. Explain to parents and caregivers the precautions your offices are taking to ensure they will remain safe during a visit, and provide an opportunity to answer parent questions via telehealth before an office visit. We encourage you to find ways to administer the vaccines, whether it is through #WellChildWednesdays or through the local health department, pharmacy, or health center. In addition, we ask that you work with partners and organizations in your communities to help prevent future outbreaks of VPD, such as measles, influenza, and whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;
Here is a quick list of ways to help families catch-up on childhood vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider extending your hours to accommodate more well-child visits and vaccine appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use reminder-recalls and/or phone parents to reach children who have fallen behind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are not able to accommodate all of your patients, consider providing referrals to pharmacies, state or local health departments, and &lt;a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/"&gt;community health centers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partner with the health department to host a vaccination clinic or event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designate an immunization champion on your staff to ensure that all staff share a consistent message with parents/caregivers about the importance of childhood immunizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;In addition to providing health care services, you can help spread the word by promoting the &lt;a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/catch-up"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catch Up to Get Ahead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; immunization campaign within social media:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use the catch-up hashtag: &lt;strong&gt;#CatchUpGetAhead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the official National Immunization Awareness Month hashtag: #ivaxtoprotect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retweet messages from @HHS_ASH, @HHSvaccines, @Surgeon_General, and other partners. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Thank you for helping expand access to childhood vaccines and for helping your community and the nation avoid preventable diseases in the months to come.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>HIV Prevention Starts with Me: Women and Girls, Ending the HIV Epidemic Together</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/today-march-10th-we-observe%25C2%25A0national-women-and-girls-hivaids-awareness-day-theme-year-%25C2%25A0hiv</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;HIV Prevention Starts with Me: Women and Girls, Ending the HIV Epidemic Together&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-posted&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;from &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/blog/hiv-prevention-starts-me-women-and-girls-ending-hiv-epidemic-together" target="_blank"&gt;HIV.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Today, March 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, we observe &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/events/awareness-days/women-and-girls"&gt;National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day&lt;/a&gt;. The theme this year is &lt;em&gt;HIV Prevention Starts with Me: Ending the HIV Epidemic Together&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
Any woman who is sexually active can get HIV, regardless of race, ethnicity, age, or sexual orientation. At the same time, statistics show that African American women have a greater chance of acquiring HIV than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
In addition, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-and-aids/hiv-prevention"&gt;women face unique challenges when it comes to preventing or living with HIV&lt;/a&gt;, as they:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/factsheets/STDs-Women.pdf"&gt;Are more vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) than men&lt;/a&gt; [PDF, 155KB], which can increase their risk of getting HIV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are more likely to experience intimate partner violence (IPV), which poses significant risks for being exposed to HIV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can pass HIV to their babies during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;The number of HIV diagnoses among women has declined in recent years; however, in 2018, more than 7,000 women in the U.S. and dependent areas received an HIV diagnosis. These numbers demonstrate that we need to adopt new approaches to reducing HIV rates among women.&lt;/p&gt;
The &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/ending-the-hiv-epidemic/overview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ending the HIV Epidemic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (EHE) initiative is doing just that by addressing the specific needs of the hundreds of thousands of women in the U.S. who are living with HIV or could be exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
Through EHE, we are working to diagnose, prevent, and treat HIV among women:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnose:&lt;/strong&gt; Testing is the first step toward ending the HIV epidemic. Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/women/index.html"&gt;1 in 9 women with HIV are unaware they are HIV-positive&lt;/a&gt;. Efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/blog/learn-more-about-cdc-s-latest-funding-opportunity-end-hiv-epidemic"&gt;improve HIV testing and scaling up PrEP screening&lt;/a&gt; in locations where women enter our healthcare system will significantly benefit them by providing prevention options and linkage to care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevent:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/using-hiv-medication-to-reduce-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis"&gt;PrEP medication&lt;/a&gt; can prevent women from getting HIV—but statistics show that not enough women who have indications for PrEP are using it. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6848e1.htm"&gt;less than 7% of women who could benefit from PrEP were using it&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ nationwide &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/ending-the-hiv-epidemic/prep-program"&gt;Ready, Set, PrEP&lt;/a&gt; program aims to increase the percentage of individuals who are taking PrEP medications by providing those who qualify with the medications at no cost. Because PrEP only protects against HIV infection, condoms are a critical and primary method for preventing other STIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an emergency, &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/using-hiv-medication-to-reduce-risk/post-exposure-prophylaxis"&gt;post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) medications&lt;/a&gt; can also prevent individuals from getting HIV if they take PEP within 72 hours of potential exposure to the virus through sex, shared needles, or sexual assault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/blog/office-women-s-health-awards-3m-support-prevention-and-screening-intimate-partner-violence-and"&gt;The Office on Women’s Health (OWH) recently awarded $3M in grants to expand prevention, screening, and response services for women at risk for IPV and HIV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat&lt;/strong&gt;: Last fall, the &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/10/25/hhs-awards-2-billion-grants-help-americans-access-hiv-care-services-medications.html"&gt;Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded $2.27B in grants&lt;/a&gt; through its &lt;a href="https://hab.hrsa.gov/about-ryan-white-hivaids-program/about-ryan-white-hivaids-program"&gt;Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program&lt;/a&gt; (RWHAP), including funding for 115 community-based organizations. These organizations will provide family-centered comprehensive HIV care and treatment for women and children. Increased investment in RWHAP and Federally Qualified Health Centers will help women living with HIV get into care and achieve and maintain viral suppression—improving their health and making them effectively unable to transmit HIV to others (Undetectable = Untransmittable [&lt;a href="https://www.preventionaccess.org/" target="_blank"&gt;U=U&lt;/a&gt; ]).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;HIV prevention and treatment are critical to reducing new cases among women and girls. We encourage women and girls–and their partners, friends, and family members who care about them—to learn more about how they can take control of their health to prevent HIV and the related stigma that keeps many from seeking testing, prevention, care, and treatment. By doing so, together we can stop HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>An Interview About Veteran Women’s Health</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/spotlight-veteran-women</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;An Interview About Veteran Women’s Health&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Coming up on August 27, 2018, the National Meeting on Active Duty and Veteran Women’s Health will bring together health professionals and researchers to discuss the specialized health care needs of active duty and veteran women. In preparation for the meeting, Dr. Sally Haskell of the Veterans Health Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), joins us on the OWH Blog. She discusses the unique risks and exposures that women veterans face that can impact their health and health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;August 24, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What is your current role at the VA?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I’m currently the Deputy Chief Consultant and National Director of Comprehensive Women’s Health for the Office of Women’s Health Services in the Veterans Health Administration, part of the VA. I’ve been with the VA for 26 years. I’m a General Internal Medicine doctor by background, and I still have an active practice, seeing women veterans one half day a week in the West Haven, Connecticut VA Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;In your time at the VA, what kind of progress have you seen in our understanding of veteran women’s health?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I’ve been working in VA health care for 26 years, and I’ve been working with women veterans for at least 20 years. The population of women veterans using VA services has tripled over that time period, so we now have over 700,000 women enrolled for VA care. Initially women veterans were considered a special population in VA, and at many sites, women’s health services weren’t readily available. That has all changed dramatically with the implementation of comprehensive women’s health care across our system in the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
We now have designated women’s health primary care providers and women’s mental health champions in all VA health care systems. We provide full gynecology services (196 gynecologists across the system) and mammography and breast cancer treatments either on-site or in the community (60 sites have on-site mammography). Women veterans are also eligible for maternity care and delivery services that are covered by VA and provided through community care.&lt;/p&gt;
Over the last ten years, we have expanded our understanding of the effects of military service on women’s lives and women veterans’ health care needs. Women veterans (especially those using the VA system) have been increasingly understood as a very resilient population, but a population that is/has been at risk of physical and mental trauma. As in the general population, some patients in the VA are very healthy, but others suffer from complex mental and physical co-morbidities. The most prevalent conditions we see in the VA among women veterans using VA care are musculoskeletal conditions, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health" title="Mental Health | womenshealth.gov"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke" title="Heart Disease and Stroke | womenshealth.gov"&gt;cardiovascular conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What makes veteran women’s health unique?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Women veterans’ health is not unique, but as a population, women veterans may have had some unique experiences and exposures. These include very positive aspects such as readiness, fitness, and resilience as well as the many skills they’ve acquired during their military service. In addition, there can be negative consequences such as exposure to occupational hazards and trauma. We have to keep all of these risks and exposures in mind as we provide care. As health professionals, we must screen for things like traumatic brain injury, sexual trauma, and the mental health consequences of trauma exposure, including &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder" title="Post-traumatic stress disorder | womenshealth.gov"&gt;post-traumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt; (PTSD). We must also be mindful of the possibility of musculoskeletal injuries, often from chronic wear and tear on women’s joints, and risk for chronic pain syndromes. In terms of reproductive health, research shows that PTSD can increase rates of pre-term delivery, so it is especially important for OB-GYN providers to be aware of military service.&lt;/p&gt;
The time of leaving the military and transitioning to civilian life can bring additional challenges to women veterans who are sometimes lacking social support, feeling a lack of recognition for their service, and dealing with family stresses.&lt;/p&gt;
Finally, in terms of cardiovascular health, we know that men and women veterans are usually in good shape when they leave the military because of physical fitness and weight requirements, but it is easy to let health habits slip. We see a lot of weight gain and development of cardiovascular risk factors after veterans leave service and enter VA care. It is important for health professionals to talk with their patients about these risks and the lifestyle changes needed to prevent heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Why is it important for health professionals to understand the issues veteran women face?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;A lot of women veterans get their medical care from community health professionals. These health professionals may not think to ask about whether a woman has served in the military, and because of that, they may not screen for the experiences and exposures that I’ve discussed above. By screening and identifying issues early, health professionals can engage women veterans in treatment and prevention and connect them with VA resources as needed. Also, having experienced trauma can impact the way a woman responds to or engages in health care experiences, so it is important for health professionals to ask women about trauma history and to practice with this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What tools do health professionals need to better care for women veterans?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I think it is important for health professionals to know how to take a military history, which includes asking if women served in the military, their location of service, and military occupation. They should be aware of screening for combat and sexual trauma, depression, and PTSD. Knowledge of principles of pain management, including pain self-management, and trauma-informed care are particularly important. Health professionals should also be aware of the services that VA provides for women veterans and know how to help veterans get enrolled and utilize VA benefits and services. Knowledge of important numbers like the Women Veteran Call Center (1-855-829-6636), the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255), and the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans (1-877-424-3838) would also be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Will you tell us about the National Meeting on Active Duty and Veteran Women’s Health?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/live/live-1/index.html#9096" title="National Meeting on Active Duty and Veteran Women's Health event page"&gt;National Meeting on Active Duty and Veteran Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; is an important collaboration between the Office on Women’s Health, the VA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the U.S. Department of Defense. It brings together clinical and behavioral health professionals and researchers for a full day of presentations on active duty service women and women veterans’ health issues with a goal of educating health professionals about the health effects of military service and VA resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What do you hope health professionals will gain from the meeting?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I hope that health professionals will go back to their practices with a recognition and respect for women veterans and be aware of common health conditions in women veterans and the unique risks and exposures that women veterans face that can impact their health and health care. I hope that this meeting will change their practices so that they always ask their patients if they’ve served in the military.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Hepatitis C: Q&amp;A With an Expert</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/spotlight-hepatitis-c</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Hepatitis C: Q&amp;A With an Expert&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 3.5 million people in the United States have hepatitis C. What exactly is it, and why should you care about hepatitis C? Corinna Dan, the Viral Hepatitis Policy Advisor at the HHS Office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy, is here to explain. Read Corinna’s interview to learn how you can get hepatitis C and whether some women are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;July 31, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What is viral hepatitis?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/viral-hepatitis"&gt;Viral hepatitis&lt;/a&gt; is a group of viruses that affect the liver. In the United States, hepatitis A, B, and C are the most common types of viral hepatitis. These viruses can cause mild to severe illness, with the most severe being liver failure and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What makes hepatitis C unique?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Hepatitis C is unique for two reasons: It is the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/viral-hepatitis#4"&gt;most common type&lt;/a&gt; of viral hepatitis in the United States, and it is one of the only curable chronic or long-lasting viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What’s the difference between an acute and chronic infection?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;An acute infection is short-term, meaning the infection lasts less than 6 months. Hepatitis C always starts as an acute infection, but 75 to 85% of acute infections become chronic, meaning that the infection can last a lifetime. If hepatitis C is left untreated, it can cause serious health problems. Problems include liver damage, cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver cancer, and even death. The good news is that new treatments can cure most people with hepatitis C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;How do you get hepatitis C?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Hepatitis C is usually spread through exposure to the blood of someone who has the infection. Today, the most common way to get hepatitis C is through sharing needles or other equipment used to inject drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
Before 1992, many people who received blood transfusions got hepatitis C, but that’s rare now because donated blood is tested for hepatitis. Though less common, hepatitis C can also be spread during unprotected sex and from a mother to her baby at the time of birth. There is no evidence that breastfeeding spreads hepatitis C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Are some women more at risk for hepatitis C than others? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Yes. Two groups of women have the highest risk for hepatitis C. Baby boomers, women born between 1945 and 1965, have the highest rate of &lt;em&gt;chronic&lt;/em&gt; infection. Millennial women, women born between approximately 1980 and 2000, have the highest rate of &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; infection. Baby boomers were often exposed to hepatitis C during blood transfusions or medical procedures before current safety standards were established. Millennials appear to have increased exposure to hepatitis C due to injection drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;How often do women need to get tested for hepatitis C? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;That depends. Most baby boomers only need to get tested once for hepatitis C. But all women who have an ongoing risk, such as continued injection drug use, should be tested for hepatitis C as soon as possible, and then every 6 to 12 months to ensure that they get care and treatment if they become infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;How is hepatitis C treated? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;New hepatitis C treatments cure more than 90% of people. These oral pills specifically target the virus and are called direct-acting agents (DAAs). DAAs consist of one or more pills taken every day for 8 to 12 weeks and have few side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What do you want women to know about hepatitis C? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Hepatitis C is curable, but too few people know that they have it. It’s worth getting tested because you can avoid future severe illness and prevent transmission to others. You can take the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/riskassessment/index.htm" title="Hepatitis Risk Assessment | Division of Viral Hepatitis | CDC"&gt;risk assessment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/viral-hepatitis#11"&gt;learn your risks&lt;/a&gt;, and ask your doctor about getting tested or find a &lt;a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/" title="HRSA Health Center Locator Tool"&gt;health center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://gettested.cdc.gov/" title="Get Tested | National HIV, STD, and Hepatitis Testing"&gt;testing location&lt;/a&gt; near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What’s your advice for women living with a chronic infection? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;With the new hepatitis C treatments, almost all people with chronic hepatitis C are recommended to be treated and cured! Ask your doctor for the treatment. Many doctors don’t know about the new treatments, so don’t take “no” for a final answer. More providers are treating more patients for hepatitis C, and more insurers are covering the treatments, so even if you have asked before, don’t be afraid to ask again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Postpartum Depression: You Are Not Alone</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/postpartum-depression</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Postpartum Depression: You Are Not Alone&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;As an obstetrician-gynecologist, I have seen many women who struggle with mood changes after having a baby. There is a common belief that childbirth is a magical time for all mothers and that as soon as the baby is born, maternal feelings and knowledge magically appear. For many women, this may not be the case. Some women struggle with feeling anxious, sad, or like they are unable to care for their baby. They might even feel powerless to take care of themselves. Ella’s story is an example of the struggle some women experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt="Frustrated mother holding her sleeping baby." src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-postpartum-depression.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;Ella’s Story&lt;/h2&gt;
Ella had her first baby when she was 32. She dealt with so much pain throughout her pregnancy that she had to take time off from work. She was looking forward to relief from her symptoms after giving birth, but her pain was replaced with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
After giving birth, Ella felt drained, but she planned to breastfeed and was eager to start. However, her baby had a hard time getting a good latch, despite the help she received from the nurses in the hospital. Every time she tried to breastfeed and couldn’t, Ella became more anxious. That made the next time she tried to breastfeed even harder, and her baby would cry because he was hungry. As this pattern continued, Ella became increasingly overwhelmed, and she began to feel inadequate. The anxiety she felt around breastfeeding continued even after her baby learned to latch. When the baby cried, she worried he was hungry because her body wasn’t making enough milk. Taking care of the baby began to feel like too much, and taking care of herself felt just as difficult. It was harder and harder to bathe herself, change her clothes, or even eat. She was also experiencing crying spells.&lt;/p&gt;
When it was time to go back to work, Ella was ready for the change. However, her feelings of being inadequate followed her on the job. She lost the confident attitude she had prior to giving birth. She questioned every decision and struggled with tasks that had been easy for her before.&lt;/p&gt;
During Ella’s postpartum visit just after 6 weeks, she didn’t mention her struggle, even when asked how she was feeling. She felt embarrassed to share her feelings and felt like a bad mother because she found it so hard to take care of her baby. It was only after a long discussion about her breastfeeding experience that she opened up to me.&lt;/p&gt;
Does Ella’s story sound familiar? Many women experience symptoms like Ella’s and are not aware that these types of feelings are common. Often, they go away on their own after a few days. But if they last for more than two weeks and do not improve, it might be postpartum depression.&lt;/p&gt;
By the end of the postpartum visit, Ella did accept a referral for counseling and agreed to check in with me once a month.  After several weeks of therapy, she told me that her mood improved and she could care for herself and her baby. She was also able to continue breastfeeding until her baby was 12 months old. Although it took several months, Ella was also able to feel confident at work again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postpartum depression: What you should know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Whether you or someone you love recently gave birth, here’s what you should know about postpartum depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You are not alone.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/postpartum-depression#2"&gt;One in 9 new mothers&lt;/a&gt; has postpartum depression. Symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling empty, sad, or overwhelmed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling irritable or moody&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crying for no apparent reason&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having difficulty with memory and concentration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having difficulty making decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enjoying activities you once enjoyed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdrawing from family and friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling like you are unable to care for your baby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;You might be at &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/postpartum-depression#5"&gt;higher risk of postpartum depression&lt;/a&gt; if you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a personal history of depression or bipolar disorder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a family history of depression or bipolar disorder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not have support from family and friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were depressed during pregnancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had problems with a previous pregnancy or birth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have relationship or money problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are younger than 20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have alcoholism, use illegal drugs, or have some other problem with drugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a baby with special needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have difficulty breastfeeding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postpartum depression is treatable.&lt;/strong&gt; Counseling and medication are effective at treating mood disorders, including postpartum depression. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/postpartum-depression#10"&gt;Treatment&lt;/a&gt; can improve your symptoms or make them go away entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your doctor can help.&lt;/strong&gt; Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling, because your treatment can begin only when your depression is identified. When asked how you are doing during visits with your doctor or your baby’s doctor, be honest. There is no reason to feel embarrassed about your feelings. Mood disorders like depression and anxiety are medical conditions that require treatment. Follow up on any treatment or referral your doctor gives you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You can ask for help.&lt;/strong&gt; Taking care of a newborn is difficult work. It is difficult to find time to take even basic care of yourself, like sleeping, eating, and bathing, when your baby needs constant attention. Ask your friends and family to help with caring for your baby so you can take care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
If you are dealing with postpartum depression, you’re not alone. Help is available, and you can feel better. Learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/postpartum-depression"&gt;postpartum depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Making the Best Decisions for Your Body</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/best-decisions-your-body</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Making the Best Decisions for Your Body&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;As women, we're the experts on our own bodies. We know what does and doesn't feel normal, but we don't always feel empowered to speak up to get the care we need. I recently had an experience with my health where I had to seek a third opinion because the recommendations my longtime doctors offered me didn't feel right. And I'm so glad I did. Here's what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nicole Greene" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/nicole-greene-holiday.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;For most of my life, I had reliably regular periods. (I'm lucky. I know this isn't every woman's experience.) But last summer, I got my period — and it didn't stop. Every time I thought my period was over, I started bleeding again. Suddenly, my &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menstrual-cycle/period-problems"&gt;periods were worse&lt;/a&gt; than they had ever been, and it wasn't just abnormal and heavy bleeding. I had significant pain, low energy, and horrible cramping, and I felt tired all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
These symptoms weren't normal for me, so I called my gynecologist. She couldn't see me right away, but I knew I couldn't wait, so I saw another doctor in the same practice. He recommended a birth control pill to control my bleeding. I was hesitant, because I'd experienced serious side effects while taking the pill in the past, but I tried it. As I feared, I had a host of new issues — headaches, vomiting, blurred vision, and more fatigue. I stopped taking the pill and made an appointment with my gynecologist of many years. She saw two small &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/uterine-fibroids"&gt;fibroids&lt;/a&gt; and recommended an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/birth-control-methods/#2"&gt;intrauterine device&lt;/a&gt; (IUD), even though she knew I'd had trouble with an IUD in the past. I know both doctors thought my cycle was changing because of my age. I wasn't so sure. But here's what I did know: I was anemic, exhausted, and cranky.&lt;/p&gt;
My husband and I talked about my options, and together, we decided that I should get another opinion. It wasn't an easy choice, especially since I'd been with my doctor for so long. But my quality of life was suffering, so I made an appointment with a new doctor who ordered a series of sonograms and ultrasounds, as well as a uterine biopsy to rule out cancer. She found several additional fibroids, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/endometriosis"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, and adenomyosis, and she believed those were causing all my pain. Ultimately, my new doctor recommended a partial &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/hysterectomy"&gt;hysterectomy&lt;/a&gt;, a procedure that would remove my uterus but allow me to keep my ovaries. Since my husband and I are done having children and I knew I couldn't continue in my current exhausted and pained state, I decided that a partial hysterectomy was the right choice for me.&lt;/p&gt;
In December, I had my hysterectomy. The procedure and recovery went smoothly, and once fully recovered, I felt immense relief. And my pain is gone. Getting a hysterectomy was the best choice for me. Of course, it helps that I didn't experience complications or side effects. Not all women are so lucky. But I am so glad I listened to my body and sought that third opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
What I've learned through this experience is that I know my body better than anyone else. I knew my symptoms weren't simply a result of getting older and a changing cycle. I knew something else was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
The same way that I'm the expert on my body, you are the expert on yours. Doctors are here to guide us and support us, but ultimately, the decisions we make about our bodies are our own. If you're experiencing symptoms that don't feel normal to you, talk to a doctor. If you're not satisfied with what they have to say, feel empowered to get a second, third, and fourth opinion. Gather as much information as you can so that you can make an informed choice. Making decisions about your body may not always be easy, but only you can make the best choice for you, your body, and your health.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>New Medicare Cards Protect Your Personal Information</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/new-medicare-card</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;New Medicare Cards Protect Your Personal Information&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Starting in April 2018, Medicare will mail new Medicare cards to all people with Medicare to help protect you from identity fraud. Fraudsters are always looking for ways to get your Social Security Number, so we’re removing Social Security Numbers from all Medicare cards to make them safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Older woman smiling" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-medicare-card-post.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;Your new card will have a new Medicare Number that’s unique to you. The new card will help protect your identity and keep your personal information more secure. Your Medicare coverage and benefits stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;
And there’s more good news: Medicare will automatically mail your new card at no cost to the address you have on file with Social Security. There’s nothing you need to do! If you need to update your official mailing address, visit your online &lt;a href="https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/" title="my Social Security"&gt;my Social Security account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
Once you get your new Medicare card, take these three steps to make it harder for someone to steal your information and identity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Destroy your old Medicare card right away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="2"&gt;Use your new card. Doctors, other health care providers, and plans approved by Medicare know that Medicare is replacing the old cards. They are ready to accept your new card when you need care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="3"&gt;Beware of people contacting you about your new Medicare card and asking you for your Medicare Number, personal information, or to pay a fee for your new card. Treat your Medicare Number like you treat your Social Security or credit card numbers. Remember, Medicare will never contact you uninvited to ask for your personal information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For more information about your new Medicare card, visit &lt;a href="https://www.medicare.gov/forms-help-and-resources/your-medicare-card.html" title="Your Medicare card"&gt;go.medicare.gov/newcard&lt;/a&gt;. You can also visit Medicare.gov for &lt;a href="https://www.medicare.gov/forms-help-and-resources/report-fraud-and-abuse/prevent-fraud/tips-to-prevent-fraud.html" title="Tips to prevent fraud"&gt;tips to prevent Medicare fraud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Kidney Disease: What You Need to Know</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/spotlight-kidney-health</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Kidney Disease: What You Need to Know&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Did you know that March is National Kidney Month? It’s a time to talk about kidney health and chronic kidney disease, a common disease among adults in the United States. That’s why we asked Dr. Kajal Patel, a doctor who specializes in kidney care and disease treatment, to share how women can keep their kidneys healthy and what they need to know about chronic kidney disease. Get her tips for kidney health and learn about women’s unique risk factors for kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;March 22, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What do our kidneys do?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Most of us have two functioning kidneys. They perform important jobs to keep our bodies working as they should, including filtering our blood to remove extra waste and fluid to make urine.&lt;/p&gt;
Our kidneys also help control our blood pressure, make red blood cells, and keep our bones healthy. If a person has kidney disease, their kidneys may not be able to perform these duties as well or at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What steps can women take to keep their kidneys healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;You can take steps to keep your kidneys healthy by leading an overall healthy life. That means eating well, exercising regularly, managing your stress, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking or quitting smoking, limiting your alcohol, and getting plenty of sleep. I also encourage you to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know the risks of kidney disease. Women who have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure are more likely to develop kidney disease. It’s important to talk to your doctor about managing any of these risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See a doctor or nurse right away if you develop a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/urinary-tract-infections" title="Urinary tract infections"&gt;urinary tract infection (UTI)&lt;/a&gt; so that they prescribe you an antibiotic to treat it. An untreated UTI can hurt your kidneys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a conversation with your doctor or nurse about kidney health at your next checkup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What is chronic kidney disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means your kidneys are damaged and they can’t filter your blood the way healthy kidneys can. There are different causes and stages of CKD, so if you are diagnosed with CKD, it’s important to work with your doctor to help you figure out the cause and come up with the right treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Are some women more likely to get chronic kidney disease than others?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Some people are more likely to get CKD than others. For example, kidney disease is more common in African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, people over 60, and people with a family history of kidney failure. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the leading causes of kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
However, we know there are some interesting reasons why women may develop CKD. Pregnancy can cause acute kidney injury (AKI), or the sudden loss of kidney function. High blood pressure and obesity in women during the years when they can have children increases the risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/glossary#preeclampsia"&gt;preeclampsia&lt;/a&gt; in pregnancy, which can lead to AKI. Women who have AKI and preeclampsia during pregnancy are at higher risk of high blood pressure and CKD later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
Additionally, autoimmune diseases like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/lupus" title="Lupus"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to affect women and can damage organs, including the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Are there steps women can take to manage chronic kidney disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Yes. For starters, finding a doctor who you trust and have a good relationship with is key to navigating life with CKD. You can work together to come up with a plan to treat your kidney disease before it leads to kidney failure (which is when your kidneys have lost most of their ability to function). Your plan may include taking medicines and managing any other conditions or diseases you’re living with, such as high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
You will also want to take steps to lead an overall healthy life, such as making &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/healthy-eating" title="Healthy Eating"&gt;healthy food choices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/stress-and-your-health" title="Stress and your health"&gt;managing stress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/getting-active" title="Getting Active"&gt;getting plenty of exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What role does nutrition play in kidney disease management?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;For women with kidney disease, it’s really important to work with your doctor and/or a dietitian to make a healthy eating plan that’s right for you. Making changes to what you eat can help keep kidney disease from getting worse. You may need to keep a close eye on the amounts of protein, salt, and important minerals in your diet. If your kidneys don’t work well, for example, too much sodium can cause fluid buildup in your body and high blood pressure, which strains your heart. You also want to watch out for potassium: Kidney disease may raise levels of the mineral in your blood, which is known as hyperkalemia. This can cause serious problems, including heart issues. In addition to taking medicine that treats hyperkalemia, women may need to cut back on foods that are high in potassium, like bananas and sweet potatoes. I know this sounds like the opposite of what most people learn about certain nutrients. That’s why it’s so important to work with an expert who can help you learn what you should eat and drink to manage kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What should women ask their doctors to learn about their risk of chronic kidney disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Ask your doctor if your risk of kidney disease is higher than normal. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart or blood vessel problems, ask whether you need to be tested for kidney disease. The only way to know whether you have kidney disease for sure is to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;
Most women will not have severe symptoms in the early stages of kidney disease. But do let your doctor know if you start noticing some of these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trouble thinking clearly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor appetite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trouble sleeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry, itchy skin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swollen feet or ankles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to urinate more often, especially at night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>HIV Prevention Starts With Me (and You) </title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/hiv-prevention-starts-you</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;HIV Prevention Starts With Me (and You) &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;We have seen tremendous improvements in HIV treatment and prevention over the past few decades. While we want to celebrate this progress, we also need to discuss how it can lead people to falsely believe that HIV is no longer a serious health issue. People across the country — including women — continue to get and transmit HIV regardless of age, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. In the United States, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/group/gender/women/cdc-hiv-women.pdf" title="HIV Among Women"&gt;one quarter of people living with HIV are women&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics" title="U.S. Statistics | U.S. Statistics"&gt;women accounted for 1 in 5 HIV diagnoses&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;img alt="National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day - 2018 Logo" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-nwghaad2018-logo3.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
My message is simple: HIV is still a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; real problem, but it is preventable.&lt;/p&gt;
On March 10, we observe &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwghaad" title="National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day"&gt;National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day&lt;/a&gt; to shed light on the impact HIV and AIDS have on women and girls. It’s also a time to remember that every single one of us has a role to play in HIV prevention — women, men, health professionals, those who are HIV-negative, and those who are HIV-positive. There are simple steps we can take to protect ourselves, our partners, and our patients from HIV infection and transmission. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If you’re HIV-negative: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a free, confidential HIV test. Visit &lt;a href="https://gettested.cdc.gov/" target="_blank" title="Get Tested"&gt;gettested.cdc.gov&lt;/a&gt; to find a testing location. Make sure you know your partner’s status, too — before you have sex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice safe sex. Use condoms every time you have sex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to your doctor about &lt;a href="https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/prevention/reduce-your-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis/" target="_blank" title="Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis | HIV.gov"&gt;pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP&lt;/a&gt;) if you have an HIV-positive partner. PrEP is a daily pill that can &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/hivprep/index.html" title="Daily Pill Can Prevent HIV"&gt;reduce your risk of getting HIV from sex by more than 90%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit a doctor right away if you think you may have been exposed to HIV. The &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-and-aids/hiv-prevention/#3" title="HIV prevention"&gt;doctor may decide that you should get post-exposure prophylaxis&lt;/a&gt;, also known as PEP. PEP is an anti-HIV medicine that may lower your chances of getting HIV after you have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re HIV-positive: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take care of your health and visit your doctor regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim to achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load by taking your medication as prescribed and for at least 6 months. Having an undetectable viral load means that you are much less likely to transmit HIV to a partner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate your partner about PrEP and PEP, if they are HIV-negative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re a health care professional: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/guidelines/index.html" title="Guidelines and Recommendations"&gt;HIV screening recommendations&lt;/a&gt; and implement them, as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to your patients about their HIV risk and how to practice safe sex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know when to recommend PrEP and PEP to HIV-negative patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with HIV-positive patients to encourage them to stay healthy and help them adhere to their treatment. Also, if they’re sexually active, educate them about PrEP and PEP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;I hope you’ll join us this National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day — and beyond — by taking steps to protect yourself and the people you love. We need you, because we all have a role to play in preventing HIV. Visit &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwghaad" title="National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day"&gt;www.womenshealth.gov/nwghaad&lt;/a&gt; to get more ideas on what you can do to stop HIV and AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>An Interview About Heart Health</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/heart-health-spotlight</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;An Interview About Heart Health&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of American women, and stroke is fourth? The good news is there are steps you can take to lower your risk of heart disease and stroke at any age. We spoke to Dr. Rachel Dreyer, an Assistant Professor at the Yale School of Medicine who specializes in cardiovascular outcomes research with a focus on women’s health. Dr. Dreyer shares the basics you need to know about heart disease and how to keep your heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;March 2, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What steps can women take for good heart health?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;There are several ways that women can help control their risk of heart disease, or, in other words, there are steps women can follow for good heart health. The American Heart Association calls them “Life’s Simple 7.” These seven steps include staying physically active, controlling levels of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/heart-disease/heart-disease-prevention#4" title="Steps women can take to prevent heart disease"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, following a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/heart-healthy-eating" title="Heart-healthy eating"&gt;heart-healthy eating plan&lt;/a&gt;, managing blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing blood sugar, and quitting smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Are there risk factors for heart disease that are out of women’s control?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Yes, there are some risk factors for heart disease that women can’t change, such as age, sex, heredity (family health history), and race or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;How can women work with their doctors to figure out their risk for heart disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Schedule a visit with your doctor to discuss your risk factors and learn more about your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/heart-disease/heart-disease-prevention#4" title="Steps women can take to prevent heart disease"&gt;heart disease numbers&lt;/a&gt; to assess your risk of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What are the heart disease numbers women need to know for good heart health? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;There are several key numbers to know, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total blood cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a waxy, fatty substance in the blood. When too much cholesterol builds up on the walls of the blood vessels, it makes it very difficult for the heart to pump blood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; or low-density lipoprotein, often called “bad” cholesterol. Bad cholesterol can cause plaque to build up, which can lead to heart disease and stroke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDL cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; or high-density lipoprotein, often called “good” cholesterol. It can help eliminate bad cholesterol from your blood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood pressure, &lt;/strong&gt;which is essentially the pressure the blood puts on the arteries as the heart beats and relaxes. Blood pressure varies depending on exercise, stress, and sleep levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; or the amount of sugar present in the bloodstream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body mass index&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. This varies depending on age, gender, and build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;To know what your numbers should be, you need to talk with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Why are these numbers important, and what steps can women take to improve them?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Knowing these numbers and the risk factors associated with heart disease can help you to take control of your health and seek advice from your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
You can control or treat some risk factors with lifestyle changes (Remember: “Life’s Simple 7.”). Your doctor may also recommend certain medicines, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
One of the best things women can do for good heart health is quit smoking. Nicotine addiction is very powerful. Women should talk to their doctors about coming up with a quit plan. They can also call the &lt;a href="https://smokefree.gov/tools-tips/speak-expert" title="Speak to an expert"&gt;smoking quitline&lt;/a&gt; at 1-800-QUIT-NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What are some small heart-healthy eating changes women can make?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I have eight tips!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat more fruit and vegetables, and aim for variety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat more whole-grain foods, including whole-wheat bread, rye bread, and brown rice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use olive, canola, or corn oil when cooking, and limit your saturated fats. You find saturated fat in foods like pizza, ice cream, and fried chicken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat more lean proteins, such as skinless poultry, fish, and vegetable protein like legumes and lentils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read food labels to make healthy food choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit sodium intake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut down on sugar-sweetened drinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat plenty of calcium-rich foods, such as dairy products and dark leafy greens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;When it comes to exercise and heart health, what should women know?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/fitness-and-nutrition/how-be-active-health" title="How to be active for health"&gt;Staying physically active&lt;/a&gt; can increase your length and quality of life and help reduce the risk of heart disease. It also leads to an overall reduction in blood pressure and can boost levels of good cholesterol. You should try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity each day, such as brisk walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What about stress?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Stress, particularly chronic stress, can negatively affect your health. It not only causes issues related to heart health, but it can also lead to uncomfortable physical symptoms like headaches and stomach problems. A stressful event causes the body to react and release a hormone, adrenaline, which speeds up your heart rate and breathing and briefly raises your blood pressure. It’s often called the “fight or flight” response. Chronic stress means that your body is in this state for days and even weeks on end, leading to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. This may damage artery walls.&lt;/p&gt;
Stress may be particularly relevant to women who previously had a heart attack. A heart attack is a life-threatening and unpredictable event, which causes serious amounts of stress during and after the event. Women who have experienced a heart attack often report feeling a lack of control, uncertainty, and helplessness. This resulting psychological stress may not only affect women’s emotional well-being, but it also negatively affects their cardiac health and recovery after the heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;
There are ways to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/stress-and-your-health" title="Stress and your health"&gt;manage stress&lt;/a&gt;. You can try exercising, maintaining a positive attitude, quitting smoking, and eating well. You also can try relaxation or stress management techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;If you could tell women one thing about heart health, what would it be?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Know your numbers and &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; your numbers. Discuss your risk factors with your doctor, and take action around the risk factors that can be controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Is there anything else you’d like to share?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Like eating well and exercising, getting plenty of sleep can help you achieve your best for your family and career, and it can improve your well-being for years to come. Sleep health is a fundamental requirement of life — it’s not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Why We Need to Talk About Men’s Mental Health</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/mens-mental-health</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Why We Need to Talk About Men’s Mental Health&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;As Men’s Health Month comes to a close, I want to talk about something that we don’t talk about enough: men and depression. While it’s not exactly a women’s health topic, our typical focus at the Office on Women’s Health, we know that most women have important men in their lives. Fathers, partners, sons, brothers, uncles, and friends. Their health matters to us. They’re why we need to have a conversation about mental health — because I worry they’re not talking about it enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nicole Greene" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/nicole-greene-holiday.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;Good mental health is as important as oxygen. You need it to survive. But there are &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/men-and-depression/index.shtml#pub1" title="Men and Depression"&gt;many different reasons&lt;/a&gt; why men are less likely to speak up about mental health problems like depression. I know one too many men who have diagnosed mental health issues but do nothing about it because they think admitting it makes them weak. They don’t want to go to the pharmacy and pick up an anti-depressant because they are afraid they will be judged. They don’t want to go to a therapist because they don’t want to share with a stranger. But if they don’t talk about it, it can be tough for friends or family members to know something is wrong. Men don’t always show the signs we often associate with depression, like sadness and hopelessness. Instead, they might appear angry or aggressive, making it easier for doctors and loved ones to miss the signs that something is wrong. As a result, men might miss out on the treatment they need to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
Depression can’t be willed away. It’s a serious mental health condition that affects a man’s daily life, including the way he eats, sleeps, feels, and thinks. It can also affect his ability to work, go to school, and maintain relationships with friends and family. Depression is NOT a sign of weakness, and it can affect any man, regardless of his age and race or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
What would cause a man in your life to develop depression? According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/men-and-depression/index.shtml#pub1" title="Men and Depression"&gt;National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;, it can be a combination of factors. For starters, his genes can play a role. Men who have a family history of depression are more likely to develop it than those who don’t. Environmental stress can trigger depression too. This includes financial problems, the loss of a loved one, work problems, a difficult relationship, a major life change, or a stressful situation. Also, depression can occur in men who have a serious medical condition like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
Getting an accurate diagnosis and following it up with treatment is essential. Most people need professional help to feel better. Without it, depression can lead to serious consequences, such as trying to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol, or worse — suicide. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., and men die by suicide at rates &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide.shtml" title="Suicide"&gt;almost four times higher&lt;/a&gt; than women. Unfortunately, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/pdf/vs-0618-suicide-H.pdf" title="CDC Vital Signs Report | Suicide rising across the US"&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt; by the Centers for Disease Control shows that suicide rates are on the rise across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
The report looked at data from 2015 to compare deaths by suicide among people with and without known mental health conditions. In both categories, men were more likely to die by suicide (84% and 69%, respectively). While depression and other mental health conditions aren’t the only risk factors for suicide, many of the issues that trigger depression can also contribute to suicide. Those include problems with health, money, and work. Substance use and problems in relationships can also contribute to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
My message this Men’s Health Month is simple: We need to talk openly about mental health. Suffering in silence isn’t a safe or healthy option for the men in our lives. Check in with them. Ask them how they’re feeling, especially if one of them has experienced a recent event that could trigger depression. Look for changes in his behavior and watch out for depression symptoms. If you think someone you love has depression, offer your support, listen, and be patient. Encourage him to talk to his doctor or a mental health professional, or you can &lt;a href="https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/" title="Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator"&gt;help him find treatment services in his area&lt;/a&gt;. Living with depression can feel overwhelming and isolating, so let him know he’s not alone. Help is available, and he can feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If you or someone you love is thinking about hurting or killing themselves, get help now. Call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>5 Ways to Build Each Other Up</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/5-ways-build</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;5 Ways to Build Each Other Up&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;We make decisions that affect our health all day long — when to go to bed, how many drinks to have, whether or not to exercise, and so on. Our choices are often influenced by the people around us. For example, if your partner wants to skip the gym, you might want to follow suit. Think about how much easier it would be to make the healthy decision if the people around you were making that choice, too. When it comes to our health, a little support can go a long way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A man and woman exercising together" class="alignright" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2016/06/5-ways-build-up-post.jpg" /&gt;It's Men's Health Month — the perfect time to team up with a man in your life to make healthy choices together. Grab your partner, roommate, friend, or father and commit to building each other up. So often our health rises and falls with those around us, so try these five tips to help you make smarter choices together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sync up your workouts.&lt;/strong&gt; Physical activity has so many health benefits, including improving sleep, reducing stress, and lowering your risk for some serious diseases. It can be easier to stick to your workouts if someone is holding you accountable. You can walk, run, hike, or bike together. If you like different activities, set aside time on both of your calendars so that you do them at the same time. You can even start a friendly competition to see who can log more steps, miles, or minutes. And if you can do some of your workouts together, that can have the additional benefit of togetherness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut back on alcohol.&lt;/strong&gt; You know that if you drink, you should do it in moderation. But did you know that the &lt;em&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/em&gt; defines moderate drinking as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men? To put that in perspective, a regular bottle of wine has five glasses in it. It can be easy to get carried away, especially if the other person is indulging, so decide to cut back together. Plan for alcohol-free nights and, when you do drink, savor it and sip slowly. It'll save you a lot of added calories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say "no" to tobacco — together.&lt;/strong&gt; I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Quitting is the best thing you can do for your health. But there's no denying that it's hard work. It's even tougher for those trying to quit around someone else who smokes. Find your reasons for quitting together, whether it's wanting to be healthier, saving money, or protecting those around you. Then come up with a &lt;a href="https://smokefree.gov/build-your-quit-plan" title="Build Your Quit Plan | Smokefree.gov"&gt;plan for quitting&lt;/a&gt;. What works for one of you may not work for the other, and that's okay. The key is to support each other and to hold each other to your shared goal of being smoke-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snack smarter.&lt;/strong&gt; It's easy to forget about the snack you munch on in front of the TV or the cracker-and-cheese appetizer you eat while making dinner. But those calories add up, and they often don't offer many nutrients. Come up with ways to snack healthier together. Instead of eating snacks right out of the bag or box, put them in a small bowl. You can also try swapping sugary or salty snacks with healthier, lower calorie options like fruits and vegetables. Cut up your vegetables ahead of time so that they're ready to go when you need a pick-me-up. Don't have time to prep? That's okay — buying a premade vegetable tray is always a good option. Get more &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/5-tips-for-healthy-summer-eating.html" title="5 Tips for Healthy Summer Eating | Office on Women's Health Blog"&gt;healthy eating tips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk about your health.&lt;/strong&gt; Talk openly and honestly about your goals so you can help each other reach them. It's also important to talk about any health concerns you may have. Encourage the man in your life to take his symptoms seriously and to get regular care — even if he feels fine. If one of you hates going to the doctor, schedule your checkups for the same day and go together. Preventive care helps you stay healthy for the long run and catches problems early when they're easiest to treat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;These are just a few ways that you and an important man in your life can inspire each other to improve your health together. Start small and set realistic goals. Remember, every day is a new opportunity to make healthier choices than you did the day before, so start today. Team up for a longer, healthier life!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Caregiving: Why We Have to Talk About It</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/caregiving-talk-about-it</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Caregiving: Why We Have to Talk About It&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ed. note: This blog is cross-posted from the Huffingtonpost.com. The original post date was May 12, 2016. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/donna-richardson/caregiving-why-we-have-to-talk-about-it_b_9930392.html" target="_blank"&gt;Read the original post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Group of women smiling" class="alignright" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2016/05/caregiving-talk-about-it-post.jpg" /&gt;I was a caregiver for 13 years for one of the most important men in my life — my father, Papa JR. Like many caregivers, I experienced the joy and the heartbreak of caring for a parent at the end of his life. It's a journey that sometimes made me laugh and other times made me cry. He lived with me until he passed last spring. It was an honor to care for him and it was a blessing to share daily life with him. But there were challenges, too.&lt;/p&gt;
The truth is that caregiving is hard work, no matter how much we love the person. And when you care for a parent, there's an added level of difficulty because you're switching roles. They become the child and you become the parent — and sometimes the nurse. If things aren't confusing enough, you're also an individual with your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
That's why I want to talk about caregiving this &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwhw/"&gt;National Women's Health Week&lt;/a&gt;. We can't sweep this issue under the rug. More people are experiencing chronic illnesses and that means many of us will at some point care for a loved one. Having knowledge and open conversations about caregiving sets us all up for success. It helps highlight the issues we face so that we can find solutions, and hearing from others helps us better prepare for the challenges. Having been a caregiver, I want to share two important pieces of advice with you — one for you as a caregiver and one for you as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Caregiver&lt;/h2&gt;
My father was living with dementia and his mind would come and go. I needed to adapt to that change, be patient, and learn as much about his condition as possible. My goal was to help him find balance within a new normal. I wanted to keep him physically, emotionally, spiritually, and mentally stimulated every day. I set goals with him and gave him things to look forward to, which included getting him involved in a lot of different activities. My favorite weekly outing was date night. One evening, my papa, who was a cheapskate, took the nurse and me out for dinner. When we went to order our drinks, he told us to get one drink and share it. His mind may not have been the sharpest, but he had a good sense of humor. Some of his favorite activities were swimming, art class, tennis, and salsa dancing (for the excitement of having beautiful women dance around him). He also loved attending The Potters House, our church. The community there truly embraced him. I was also able to build a support system outside of the home, which made caregiving less overwhelming for me. I think that's the key — realizing that you can't do it all yourself. It doesn't make you a bad caregiver. It makes you a better one.&lt;/p&gt;
With increased medical costs, it's important to do research to find a plan that works best for you. Educate yourself about the illness, learn caregiving techniques, accept help, seek resources, set realistic goals, and prioritize. And make sure you have a financial plan. (Some general online reading can be a good place to start. Try &lt;a href="http://www.caregiving.org/" target="_blank"&gt;caregiving.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicare.gov/"&gt;Medicare.gov&lt;/a&gt;.) First decide on and then map out your plan of care. Find out how your family and friends can support you. Look for caregiving services in your community, such as a local hospital program, adult care center, or church. Our church had a great program called Golden Days. My father looked forward to attending every Thursday, not just to socialize but to enjoy lunchtime. He never turned down a meal. The people you meet can become your extended family. They'll offer much needed support for you and the person you're caring for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Individual&lt;/h2&gt;
You've heard it before, but I'll say it again: In order to take care of others, you must first take care of yourself. If we don't prioritize our own health, how can we be our best selves or take care of our loved ones? I take time for me every morning. I call it PMS, but it's good PMS! It stands for prayer, meditation, and stretching. It sets me up for a successful day because it soothes my soul, energizes my body, and uplifts my spirit. When I don't take this time for me in the morning, I notice a huge difference. It keeps me balanced and centered.&lt;/p&gt;
As a wellness expert for 25 years, I recommend that you incorporate a healthy daily regiment, focusing on your mind, body, and spirit. We all have busy, hectic schedules, but your health is not an option. It's a necessity. It doesn't have to be time consuming. Maybe it means getting up 10 minutes earlier to get pumped up, powered up, and prayed up for the day. Invest in yourself, just like you invest in the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
I hope my experiences can help you as you navigate your own caregiving journey. Caring for my father had its challenges, but it was well worth it. No matter how and when you enter caregiving, remember to be loving, patient, honorable, and respectful. Although I have received many awards and accolades, caregiving is my greatest achievement. My papa once told his nurse, "Darn, I got a good daughter." As the anniversary of his death is approaching, I thank God for strengthening me during the journey and I will cherish forever the sweet and loving memories I shared with my papa.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Make a Difference in the Lives of the Men You Love </title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/make-difference-men</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Make a Difference in the Lives of the Men You Love &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="An older couple going bicycle riding." class="alignright" height="300" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2015/06/make-difference-men-post.jpg" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width="450" /&gt;June is Men's Health Month. Wait, why are we talking about men's health on a women's health website? Because men's health affects women in some pretty significant ways, and there's a lot you can do to help the men in your life lead longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;
Let's start with the basics. In general, men have poorer health habits and are less likely to take preventive health steps than women. Men are 24% less likely than women to have visited a health care provider in the past year. When they do get medical attention, they often cancel follow-up appointments, don't finish their prescriptions, and play down the seriousness of illnesses and diseases. Men are also more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, and make risky choices, such as not wearing a seatbelt. The results? Men are about 60% more likely than women to die of heart disease and over 40% more likely to die of cancer. On average, women live about five years longer than men.&lt;/p&gt;
What's heartbreaking is that some of these deaths can be prevented, but for some reason, too many men are unwilling or unable to make the basic (but, admittedly, not always easy) changes that could literally save their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
So what can we do as women to help the men in our lives take better care of themselves? Let's start by understanding why it may be difficult for some men to take the same approach to health as you. Traditionally, boys were brought up not to cry, complain, or show signs of weakness. As a result, it's my experience that many men think that what they don't know can't hurt them. Unfortunately, ignorance isn't bliss. I call it the "terrible toos." In their 20s, men are too tough to see a doctor. In their 30s, they're too busy to take time for preventive care. In their 40s and beyond, they're too afraid of what they might find out. Let the men in your life know that preventive care is important for everyone — even if they feel fine — because it catches problems early, when they're easier to treat. If your partner is nervous about getting a checkup, offer to go with him or meet him afterward for coffee or lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
There are many other ways you can help the men in your life lead longer, healthier lives. Be a role model for them and set a good example by following these additional preventive health tips. The best part is, you can do a lot of them together!&lt;/p&gt;

Fadich, MPH, CHES" class="alignright" height="315" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2015/06/make-difference-men-post2.jpg" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width="265" /&gt;Make time for exercise. &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/health/index.html" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/health/index.html'); return false;" title="Physical Activity for Everyone: The Benefits of Physical Activity | DNPAO | CDC"&gt;Physical activity&lt;/a&gt; can help you control your weight and reduce your risk for serious diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Quit smoking. &lt;a href="http://smokefree.gov/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://smokefree.gov/'); return false;" title="Smokefree.gov"&gt;Help loved ones quit, too&lt;/a&gt;. It's the best thing you can do for your health and for the health of those around you.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate yourself. Learn about common health issues affecting both men and women. Share what you learn with the men in your life. You can get all the information you need at &lt;a href="http://www.menshealthnetwork.org/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.menshealthnetwork.org/'); return false;" title="Mens Health Network"&gt;menshealthnetwork.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/" title="womenshealth.gov"&gt;womenshealth.gov&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about health. Talking openly and honestly about health can help you and your family feel more comfortable sharing health concerns or symptoms with each other. Take even the smallest symptoms seriously and discuss them with a health care provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;These changes may not happen overnight. Building healthier habits takes time. Eventually, though, you may be able to improve the quality — and the length — of the lives of the men you love. And in the process, you'll be improving your own quality of life, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Stop STIs: Six Steps to Safer Sex</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Stop STIs: Six Steps to Safer Sex&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="A couple close together" class="alignright" height="285" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2015/04/6-steps-post.jpg" width="400" /&gt;Whether you call them sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), one thing is true: Women are at risk of infection. Not only does a woman's anatomy make her vulnerable to STIs, women are less likely to have symptoms than men. Untreated STIs can lead to serious health issues, including infertility, cancer, and even death. It's not fun to think about, but protecting yourself from STIs like genital herpes, genital warts, chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIV is an important part of staying healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
Here are six ways to protect yourself from STIs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the facts.&lt;/strong&gt; About 20 million new STIs occur in the United States every year, affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. Many STIs are spread through intimate sexual contact, but you don't have to have vaginal or anal sex to be at risk — some common STIs are spread easily by oral sex and genital touching. And because many STIs have only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, you can't tell by looking at someone whether or not they have an infection. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/sexually-transmitted-infections.html"&gt;Know the STI basics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to your partner.&lt;/strong&gt; It's important to talk with your partner about STIs and practicing safe sex &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you have sex. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-aids/preventing-hiv-infection/practice-safer-sex.html#b"&gt;Get tips for talking with your partner&lt;/a&gt;, and set the ground rules together. Also, don't assume you're at low risk for STIs if you have sex with only one partner at a time. That person may be having sex with others.
If you have been forced, pressured, or coerced into having sexual contact without protection, &lt;a href="https://rainn.org/get-help/national-sexual-assault-hotline" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://rainn.org/get-help/national-sexual-assault-hotline'); return false;"&gt;there are people who can help you&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone deserves to be in control of their own health, including their sexual health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get tested.&lt;/strong&gt; It's important to know whether or not you have an infection — to make sure it's treated quickly and to avoid spreading it to others. If you are infected, you can take steps to protect yourself and your partner(s). Many STIs can be easily diagnosed and treated, and under the Affordable Care Act, &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/#part=2" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/#part=2'); return false;"&gt;STI prevention, screening, and counseling services&lt;/a&gt; are fully covered by most insurance plans, at no cost to you. Talk to your health care provider at your &lt;a href="http://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/everyday-healthy-living/sexual-health/get-your-well-woman-visit-every-year" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/everyday-healthy-living/sexual-health/get-your-well-woman-visit-every-year'); return false;"&gt;annual well-woman visit&lt;/a&gt; about which &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/screeningReccs.htm" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/screeningReccs.htm'); return false;"&gt;STIs tests&lt;/a&gt; you might need.
&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/hiv/stdfact-std-hiv.htm" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/std/hiv/stdfact-std-hiv.htm'); return false;"&gt;Having an STI can also increase your risk for getting HIV.&lt;/a&gt; The same behaviors and situations that put you at risk for STIs also put you at increased risk for getting HIV. Plus, some types of STIs may cause sores or breaks in your skin that make HIV transmission easier. If you test positive for an STI, you should also &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-aids/get-tested-for-hiv/"&gt;get tested for HIV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice monogamy.&lt;/strong&gt; This means being in a sexual relationship with only one partner who is also faithful to you. Make sure you've both been tested for STIs and know each other's results. Condoms should be used with any partner outside of a long-term, monogamous sexual relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use condoms.&lt;/strong&gt; Use a condom correctly every time you have anal, vaginal, or oral sex to reduce the risk of STI transmission. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-aids/preventing-hiv-infection/practice-safer-sex.html#mc"&gt;Get tips for using male and female condoms correctly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get vaccinated.&lt;/strong&gt; Safe and effective vaccines are available to help prevent the spread of the human papillomavirus (HPV). While it's recommended for kids who are 11 or 12, young women can receive the series of shots through the age of 26. HPV vaccines can help protect you from the types of HPV that cause most cervical cancers. Vaccines for HPV are covered as &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/'); return false;"&gt;preventive services&lt;/a&gt; under the Affordable Care Act, which means most insurers must cover them at no cost to you. Learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/human-papillomavirus.html"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt;, then talk to your doctor about whether the vaccines are right for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, taking steps to protect yourself is easier than ever. Most insurers must cover STI screening, counseling, and HPV vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/'); return false;"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; at no cost to you, even if you haven't met your yearly deductible.&lt;/p&gt;
If you think you may have been exposed to infection, get tested right away. The sooner you get a diagnosis, the sooner you can start treatment and reduce the risk of spreading it to others. &lt;a href="http://hivtest.cdc.gov/STDTesting.aspx" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://hivtest.cdc.gov/STDTesting.aspx'); return false;"&gt;Find a testing site near you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
Remember, it's your body. By taking steps to protect yourself, you can lower your risk for STIs. Please share this important reminder with the teen girls and women in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Turning 26 Soon? Start Birthday Shopping for Health Insurance Now!</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/turning-26-insurance</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Turning 26 Soon? Start Birthday Shopping for Health Insurance Now!&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Celebrate your 26th birthday with affordable health coverage. Special enrollment. Healthcare.gov" class="alignright" height="300" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2014/10/26th-blog-post-300x300.jpg" width="300" /&gt;Were you — or was someone you love — born in late 1988? Start planning for your birthday now!&lt;/p&gt;
That's the message I shared several times with my son, who turned 26 in August. Why? Because turning 26 meant he could no longer be covered under my health insurance plan.&lt;/p&gt;
Thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/can-i-keep-my-child-on-my-insurance-until-age-26/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/can-i-keep-my-child-on-my-insurance-until-age-26/'); return false;"&gt;Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt;, young adults under 26 have the option to stay on their parents' insurance plans. For my son and me, this was a great benefit. I got to rest easy knowing he had access to preventive and emergency care, and it gave him the freedom to pursue a job based on his passion and not on its insurance benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
What happens when you turn 26? You're responsible for signing up for your own coverage. Some young adults have access to job-based plans, while others, like my son, do not. That's when you turn to the &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/'); return false;"&gt;Health Insurance Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
If you turn 26 outside an Open Enrollment period, don't worry. You can still get covered! Life events — like turning 26 — mean you may qualify for a &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/how-can-i-get-coverage-outside-of-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/how-can-i-get-coverage-outside-of-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/'); return false;"&gt;Special Enrollment Period&lt;/a&gt;. Some other qualifying life events include getting married, having a baby, or moving to a new state.&lt;/p&gt;
If you're wondering whether there's a catch, the answer is no — you just have to make the time to use the Marketplace. That's the part that was a struggle for my son. Despite multiple attempts on my part, my 26-year-old (who can procrastinate with the best of them) waited until three days before his birthday to sign up for coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
The good news is that he found a great plan with monthly premiums he can afford. The bad news is that the insurance didn't go into effect until October 1. So he was uninsured for a month and a half! Cue for my anxiety. Fortunately he made it to October 1 without needing health insurance. I had a big sigh of relief that morning!&lt;/p&gt;
That's why I want to spread the message to young adults and their parents that it takes time for a new plan to go into effect. Shopping for new insurance isn't like buying something from an online retailer. It doesn't go into effect immediately, so start as early as possible. If it's 60 days before (or after) your birthday, you can &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/marketplace/b/welcome/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/marketplace/b/welcome/'); return false;"&gt;start your application&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
For all of you who are on your parents' insurance plan, I encourage you to be proactive about getting covered before your 26th birthday. Your parents cannot enroll for you. It takes time to find the plan that's best for you, and going without insurance is a risky option. Insurance helps you stay well and helps you if you become ill or injured. Stay healthy and hang on to your savings by getting covered! Find out if you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period by &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/how-can-i-get-coverage-outside-of-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/how-can-i-get-coverage-outside-of-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/'); return false;"&gt;watching this video&lt;/a&gt;. For parents like me, remind your soon-to-be 26-year-old not to wait until their birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
Tell us about your experience purchasing your own health insurance for the first time below.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How Can We Have Healthier Moms and Babies?</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/healthier-moms-babies</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;How Can We Have Healthier Moms and Babies?&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="A woman talking to a doctor." class="alignright" height="154" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/how-to-talk-to-doctor_post.jpg" width="200" /&gt;Did you know that half of pregnancies in the U.S. are not planned? And did you know that planned pregnancies are better for mothers' and infants' health? That's why the U.S. Office of Population Affairs and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released formal &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/QFP.htm" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/QFP.htm'); return false;"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; on family planning services.&lt;/p&gt;
I spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opa/about-opa-and-initiatives/opa-organizational-structure/senior-staff/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.hhs.gov/opa/about-opa-and-initiatives/opa-organizational-structure/senior-staff/'); return false;"&gt;Susan B. Moskosky&lt;/a&gt;, acting director of the Office of Population Affairs, to learn more about quality family planning and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Health professionals have been eagerly waiting for these new recommendations. Why should the general public be interested in recommendations for health providers?&lt;/h2&gt;
Whether women and couples want to prevent pregnancy, are thinking about getting pregnant for the first time, or already have children, it's important to think about family planning. Knowing whether you want to have a child in the next few years can help you have a healthier pregnancy and birth. Problems such as early delivery or babies born at low birthweight can often be prevented. Let's prevent these conditions because they can lead to lifelong health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
The new recommendations define what high-quality family planning services are and how to best provide them for women, men, and adolescents. The recommendations are for all primary care providers — like your family doctor or nurse practitioner — not just for obstetrician/gynecologists. Our vision is that over time, every primary care provider will ask every patient of reproductive age about their goals for having or not having children and work with them to meet those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do the recommendations address services for women and couples who want to have children, as well as for those who want to prevent pregnancy?&lt;/h2&gt;
Yes. For those who want to delay or prevent pregnancy altogether, the recommendations describe specifically how health providers can most effectively help their patients avoid pregnancy until they are ready to care for a(nother) child. For example, research shows that patients are more likely to choose more &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/PDF/Contraceptive_methods_508.pdf" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/PDF/Contraceptive_methods_508.pdf'); return false;"&gt;effective birth control&lt;/a&gt; when the most effective methods are discussed first. A woman who uses a more effective contraceptive method is less likely to have an unplanned pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
The recommendations also suggest that health providers — such as doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants — talk about &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/preconception/index.html?s_cid=ncbddd_govd_123" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/preconception/index.html?s_cid=ncbddd_govd_123'); return false;"&gt;preconception health&lt;/a&gt; with their patients who might want to have children now or in the future. Women and men in their reproductive years (15–44) need to maintain their health and take care of health issues, both for their own wellbeing and for the wellbeing of any children they may have. Preconception health care includes health screenings, as well as counseling and education on topics like quitting smoking before pregnancy, achieving a healthy weight, and managing chronic conditions like diabetes that could affect a future pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What else should a high-quality family planning visit include?&lt;/h2&gt;
A family planning visit can include many different services, depending on the patient's individual needs. It could include contraceptive care, preconception health, pregnancy testing and counseling, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), reproductive life planning, and basic infertility services. The new recommendations also include suggestions for related preventive services, such as breast and cervical cancer screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is something else you'd like our readers to know?&lt;/h2&gt;
We looked at both the research and ways to make family planning services more "client-friendly" in order to provide women and men with the highest standard of care. For example, research shows that pelvic exams are not generally needed for a woman to safely receive a prescription for hormonal birth control methods like the pill, patch, or ring. Of course, a pelvic exam is needed for certain types of birth control — in order to have an IUD inserted or a diaphragm fitted, for example. A pelvic exam may also be needed to address a medical issue. However, the recommendations emphasize removing unnecessary barriers to providing contraception safely to more women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It seems women and men can also ask their family doctors about family planning.&lt;/h2&gt;
Yes, we encourage patients to ask questions and start family planning conversations with their health providers. It will take all of us working together to improve on the number of pregnancies that are planned and spaced appropriately, in order to improve overall maternal and child health.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>One Woman's Story: Being With Someone Through Depression</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/one-womans-story-being-someone-through-depression</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;One Woman's Story: Being With Someone Through Depression&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Anne Wheaton" class="alignleft" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/anne-wheaton-blog-200x300.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 300px;" /&gt;Being with someone who is struggling with depression is never easy. It is difficult to see someone you care about struggle with anger, irritation, sleep changes, lifelessness, anxiety, or even worthlessness. And it's difficult when those feelings affect both of your lives.&lt;/p&gt;
Anne Wheaton watched her husband, Wil Wheaton, experience anger, self-doubt, sadness, and hopelessness for three years. He didn't know the cause of these feelings, but they inevitably affected his relationship with Anne.&lt;/p&gt;
Anne shared her story with us in honor of Men's Health Month. She helps us show that men often experience depression differently than women, and that a man's health can play a role in his partner's wellbeing too.&lt;/p&gt;
I encourage you to read our &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/news/spotlights/2014/6.html"&gt;full interview with Anne&lt;/a&gt;. She discusses her husband's symptoms, how those symptoms affected their relationship, and why he finally decided to get help. Their story offers hope to those experiencing or living with someone who has symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
If you or someone you love has a mental illness, help is available. Please remember that recovery like Wil's is possible. For more information about signs of mental health problems and how to get help, please visit our sections on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/"&gt;Mental Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mens-health/mental-health-for-men/index.html"&gt;Mental health for men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

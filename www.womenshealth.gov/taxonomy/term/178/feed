  <title>HIV Prevention Starts with Me: Women and Girls, Ending the HIV Epidemic Together</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/today-march-10th-we-observe%25C2%25A0national-women-and-girls-hivaids-awareness-day-theme-year-%25C2%25A0hiv</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;HIV Prevention Starts with Me: Women and Girls, Ending the HIV Epidemic Together&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-posted&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;from &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/blog/hiv-prevention-starts-me-women-and-girls-ending-hiv-epidemic-together" target="_blank"&gt;HIV.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Today, March 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, we observe &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/events/awareness-days/women-and-girls"&gt;National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day&lt;/a&gt;. The theme this year is &lt;em&gt;HIV Prevention Starts with Me: Ending the HIV Epidemic Together&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
Any woman who is sexually active can get HIV, regardless of race, ethnicity, age, or sexual orientation. At the same time, statistics show that African American women have a greater chance of acquiring HIV than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
In addition, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-and-aids/hiv-prevention"&gt;women face unique challenges when it comes to preventing or living with HIV&lt;/a&gt;, as they:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/factsheets/STDs-Women.pdf"&gt;Are more vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) than men&lt;/a&gt; [PDF, 155KB], which can increase their risk of getting HIV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are more likely to experience intimate partner violence (IPV), which poses significant risks for being exposed to HIV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can pass HIV to their babies during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;The number of HIV diagnoses among women has declined in recent years; however, in 2018, more than 7,000 women in the U.S. and dependent areas received an HIV diagnosis. These numbers demonstrate that we need to adopt new approaches to reducing HIV rates among women.&lt;/p&gt;
The &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/ending-the-hiv-epidemic/overview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ending the HIV Epidemic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (EHE) initiative is doing just that by addressing the specific needs of the hundreds of thousands of women in the U.S. who are living with HIV or could be exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
Through EHE, we are working to diagnose, prevent, and treat HIV among women:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnose:&lt;/strong&gt; Testing is the first step toward ending the HIV epidemic. Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/women/index.html"&gt;1 in 9 women with HIV are unaware they are HIV-positive&lt;/a&gt;. Efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/blog/learn-more-about-cdc-s-latest-funding-opportunity-end-hiv-epidemic"&gt;improve HIV testing and scaling up PrEP screening&lt;/a&gt; in locations where women enter our healthcare system will significantly benefit them by providing prevention options and linkage to care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevent:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/using-hiv-medication-to-reduce-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis"&gt;PrEP medication&lt;/a&gt; can prevent women from getting HIV—but statistics show that not enough women who have indications for PrEP are using it. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6848e1.htm"&gt;less than 7% of women who could benefit from PrEP were using it&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ nationwide &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/ending-the-hiv-epidemic/prep-program"&gt;Ready, Set, PrEP&lt;/a&gt; program aims to increase the percentage of individuals who are taking PrEP medications by providing those who qualify with the medications at no cost. Because PrEP only protects against HIV infection, condoms are a critical and primary method for preventing other STIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an emergency, &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/using-hiv-medication-to-reduce-risk/post-exposure-prophylaxis"&gt;post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) medications&lt;/a&gt; can also prevent individuals from getting HIV if they take PEP within 72 hours of potential exposure to the virus through sex, shared needles, or sexual assault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/blog/office-women-s-health-awards-3m-support-prevention-and-screening-intimate-partner-violence-and"&gt;The Office on Women’s Health (OWH) recently awarded $3M in grants to expand prevention, screening, and response services for women at risk for IPV and HIV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat&lt;/strong&gt;: Last fall, the &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/10/25/hhs-awards-2-billion-grants-help-americans-access-hiv-care-services-medications.html"&gt;Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded $2.27B in grants&lt;/a&gt; through its &lt;a href="https://hab.hrsa.gov/about-ryan-white-hivaids-program/about-ryan-white-hivaids-program"&gt;Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program&lt;/a&gt; (RWHAP), including funding for 115 community-based organizations. These organizations will provide family-centered comprehensive HIV care and treatment for women and children. Increased investment in RWHAP and Federally Qualified Health Centers will help women living with HIV get into care and achieve and maintain viral suppression—improving their health and making them effectively unable to transmit HIV to others (Undetectable = Untransmittable [&lt;a href="https://www.preventionaccess.org/" target="_blank"&gt;U=U&lt;/a&gt; ]).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;HIV prevention and treatment are critical to reducing new cases among women and girls. We encourage women and girls–and their partners, friends, and family members who care about them—to learn more about how they can take control of their health to prevent HIV and the related stigma that keeps many from seeking testing, prevention, care, and treatment. By doing so, together we can stop HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>HIV Prevention Starts With Me (and You) </title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/hiv-prevention-starts-you</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;HIV Prevention Starts With Me (and You) &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;We have seen tremendous improvements in HIV treatment and prevention over the past few decades. While we want to celebrate this progress, we also need to discuss how it can lead people to falsely believe that HIV is no longer a serious health issue. People across the country — including women — continue to get and transmit HIV regardless of age, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. In the United States, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/group/gender/women/cdc-hiv-women.pdf" title="HIV Among Women"&gt;one quarter of people living with HIV are women&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics" title="U.S. Statistics | U.S. Statistics"&gt;women accounted for 1 in 5 HIV diagnoses&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;img alt="National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day - 2018 Logo" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-nwghaad2018-logo3.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
My message is simple: HIV is still a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; real problem, but it is preventable.&lt;/p&gt;
On March 10, we observe &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwghaad" title="National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day"&gt;National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day&lt;/a&gt; to shed light on the impact HIV and AIDS have on women and girls. It’s also a time to remember that every single one of us has a role to play in HIV prevention — women, men, health professionals, those who are HIV-negative, and those who are HIV-positive. There are simple steps we can take to protect ourselves, our partners, and our patients from HIV infection and transmission. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If you’re HIV-negative: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a free, confidential HIV test. Visit &lt;a href="https://gettested.cdc.gov/" target="_blank" title="Get Tested"&gt;gettested.cdc.gov&lt;/a&gt; to find a testing location. Make sure you know your partner’s status, too — before you have sex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice safe sex. Use condoms every time you have sex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to your doctor about &lt;a href="https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/prevention/reduce-your-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis/" target="_blank" title="Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis | HIV.gov"&gt;pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP&lt;/a&gt;) if you have an HIV-positive partner. PrEP is a daily pill that can &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/hivprep/index.html" title="Daily Pill Can Prevent HIV"&gt;reduce your risk of getting HIV from sex by more than 90%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit a doctor right away if you think you may have been exposed to HIV. The &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-and-aids/hiv-prevention/#3" title="HIV prevention"&gt;doctor may decide that you should get post-exposure prophylaxis&lt;/a&gt;, also known as PEP. PEP is an anti-HIV medicine that may lower your chances of getting HIV after you have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re HIV-positive: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take care of your health and visit your doctor regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim to achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load by taking your medication as prescribed and for at least 6 months. Having an undetectable viral load means that you are much less likely to transmit HIV to a partner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate your partner about PrEP and PEP, if they are HIV-negative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re a health care professional: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/guidelines/index.html" title="Guidelines and Recommendations"&gt;HIV screening recommendations&lt;/a&gt; and implement them, as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to your patients about their HIV risk and how to practice safe sex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know when to recommend PrEP and PEP to HIV-negative patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with HIV-positive patients to encourage them to stay healthy and help them adhere to their treatment. Also, if they’re sexually active, educate them about PrEP and PEP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;I hope you’ll join us this National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day — and beyond — by taking steps to protect yourself and the people you love. We need you, because we all have a role to play in preventing HIV. Visit &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwghaad" title="National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day"&gt;www.womenshealth.gov/nwghaad&lt;/a&gt; to get more ideas on what you can do to stop HIV and AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Sex and the Senior Woman</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/sex-senior-woman</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Sex and the Senior Woman&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;For older women, wellness priorities can be pretty straightforward: To be our healthiest selves, we need to see the doctor for checkups, eat well, get regular physical activity, pay attention to our mental health, and avoid unhealthy behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Dr. Cheryl Phillips" class="alignright" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/sex-senior-woman-post.jpg" /&gt;But what about sexual intimacy?&lt;/p&gt;
There are many beliefs and myths about aging and sex. A common one is that people 55 and older don't have, think about, or want sex. That's not always true. Our needs as human beings don't change just because we age. We all need interaction with others, social connections, and for many, sexual intimacy and romantic relationships. In fact, older women who remain sexually active tend to have higher self-esteem and higher levels of social engagement and satisfaction in life.&lt;/p&gt;
After menopause, you may be relieved to not worry about birth control, but that newfound freedom doesn't mean you should forget about safe sex. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/sexually-transmitted-infections.html " title="Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) | womenshealth.gov"&gt; We still need to protect ourselves from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) &lt;/a&gt;by using condoms with new partners, being monogamous or limiting our number of partners, and getting tested for STIs. That means talking openly and honestly with doctors and nurses. Unfortunately, for a lot of women, talking about sex is uncomfortable. If you're of a certain age or were with only one partner for many years, you may not have discussed these things with a doctor in a long time. But there's good reason to start: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people aged 55 and older accounted for 26% of all Americans living with diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV infection in 2013. I encourage you to think about the questions you have about yourself, your body, and your relationships. Don't be afraid to bring them up to your doctor or nurse. Trust me — they've heard it all and can help you figure out the best way to stay healthy while enjoying sexual intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
As people age, they may need more daily help and care than they can get from living with family or independently. But just because you move into an assisted-living community or nursing home, that doesn't mean you have to give up your intimate relationships! If you're considering moving into a nursing home or already live in one, you may be worried about what you are and are not allowed to do. Or you may feel awkward about not having as much privacy as you're used to.&lt;/p&gt;
Recognizing that healthy sexuality is an important part of adult relationships, nursing and assisted-living communities should outline community values, clarify staff responsibilities, and protect residents' relationships and emotional and physical health. This can be a huge help to residents and staff. They help prevent embarrassing situations and unnecessary conflict, and they can help staff work through their beliefs (and potential misconceptions) about older adults and sex. They also help to address some complex issues like consent, abuse, and how much residents' families need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
Healthy sexual and romantic relationships are an important part of many adults' lives. We shouldn't have to give them up just because we're older.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Tools to Promote Gender Responsiveness in HIV Prevention Programs for Women and Girls</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/gender-responsiveness-hiv</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Tools to Promote Gender Responsiveness in HIV Prevention Programs for Women and Girls&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ed. note: This blog is cross-posted from HIV.gov. The original post date was June 13, 2016. &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/blog/tools-to-promote-gender-responsiveness-in-hiv-prevention-programs-for-women-and-girls"&gt;Read the original post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Cover page of the HIV Prevention Toolkit: A Gender-Responsive Approach" class="alignright" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2016/06/gender-responsiveness-hiv-post.jpg" /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you plan, design, implement, monitor, or evaluate HIV prevention programs for women and adolescent girls? If so, this is a blog post you won't want to miss!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
One in four people living with HIV in the U.S. are women or girls. There are significant differences in the underlying causes and consequences of female HIV infections that reflect differences in biology, sexual behavior, societal attitudes and pressures, and economic power.&lt;/p&gt;
At the Office on Women's Health (OWH) and the Office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy (OHAIDP), we recognize that gender-related issues are a key driver of this epidemic among women and girls. That's why OWH developed the &lt;em&gt;HIV Prevention Toolkit: A Gender-Responsive Approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Here's what you need to know about the Toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who should use the Toolkit?&lt;/h2&gt;
The Toolkit is designed for health departments, clinical staff, academics, program planners, managers, and community providers who are involved in HIV prevention programs for women and adolescent girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why integrate gender considerations into HIV and AIDS programs and services?&lt;/h2&gt;
Considering gender in HIV prevention programming is important because gender inequalities and inequity significantly impact women's and adolescent girls' vulnerability and risk for HIV infection. Separate from sex (the biological and physiological characteristics that define human beings as female or male), gender — the social, cultural, or community designations of masculinity or femininity — may affect a person's power in sexual relationships, economic stability, and exposure to and risk of violence. By identifying and addressing gender-based concerns, those working on HIV prevention can improve the impact of programs and services for women and adolescent girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's in the Toolkit and how does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
The Toolkit is composed of six sections. Sections 1 through 4 provide background on gender as a social determinant of health and the impact of gender on HIV risk and vulnerability. Sections 5 and 6 explain how to conduct a gender analysis, such as examining gender-based differences in the patterns of HIV incidence, modes of transmission, and access to treatment and care, in order to integrate these factors in HIV prevention programming. Gender disparities are discussed across four domains, including gender norms, gender roles, power and decision-making, and access to and control of resources. These domains are used to guide HIV prevention programs in conducting gender analysis and developing gender-responsive programs.&lt;/p&gt;
The Toolkit also comes with a companion Training Guide, which includes a Facilitator's Manual and Participant's Manual. These materials offer everything needed to run a three-day training for health department staff and other organizations implementing HIV programs. The Facilitator's Manual provides talking points and slides for each day of the training. The Participant's Manual contains the same slides and handouts for every day of training. By the end of the training, participants will be prepared to design and deliver gender-responsive programming.&lt;/p&gt;
While the Toolkit is targeted towards prevention for heterosexual women and adolescent girls, the gender and HIV issues covered in the Toolkit provide a foundation for gender analysis that can also be applicable to lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women. OWH and OHAIDP expect this Toolkit will help program planners and managers address gender issues and inequalities, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of HIV prevention and support services for women and adolescent girls in the United States. By incorporating gender-responsive approaches into HIV prevention programs, we support the &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/national-hiv-aids-strategy/overview" title="aids.gov ? Overview"&gt;National HIV/AIDS Strategy&lt;/a&gt; and improve the health outcomes for women and girls.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What Your Gynecologist Wants You to Know</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/what-gynecologist-wants-you-know</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;What Your Gynecologist Wants You to Know&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption caption-right"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-width-container" style="width: 313px;"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-inner"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. Sara Imershein" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2016/04/what-gynecologist-wants-you-to-know-post.jpg" width="313" /&gt;&lt;p class="caption-text"&gt;Dr. Sara Imhershein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Does the thought of going to the gynecologist make you wince? It doesn't have to. It may never become your favorite thing, but with a little planning (and a bit of courage!), your visit can be a powerful part of your overall health plan. To help you get the most out of your next trip, we sat down with gynecologist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaraImersheinMD" target="_blank" title="Sara Imershein MD (@SaraImersheinMD) on Twitter"&gt;Dr. Sara Imershein&lt;/a&gt; to get her thoughts on how to prepare for your visit — and how to ask those embarrassing questions.
&lt;strong&gt;Q: How long have you been a gynecologist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; For over 35 years. I graduated from medical school in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: I bet that adds up to a lot of well-woman visits. Why do you think women should get annual checkups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It gives you an opportunity to build a relationship with your doctor and learn what preventive health steps you can take for your short- and long-term health. Having a relationship with your gynecologist can really offer you the kind of education you need about what's appropriate at every stage in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: What should women do to prepare for their well-woman visits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Write down a list of questions. Sometimes patients are embarrassed to bring out their list, but I love a list. With a list, you won't walk out worrying about what you forgot to ask. If it's long, sometimes I'll say, "We'll only get through a certain number of things today, but let's schedule a follow-up appointment." Follow-up visits may not be free or without a copay.&lt;/p&gt;
Also, make sure you write down the name and dosage of all your medicines. We even want to know about the medicines that don't require a prescription (such as supplements, herbal products, energy boosters, vitamins, or cold medicines).&lt;/p&gt;
Keep in mind that when you book a well-woman visit, it's just a check-in for a "well" woman, so we've only put aside enough time for a checkup.&lt;/p&gt;
However, if you have a complaint or concern, such as pain, abnormal bleeding, or recurring urinary infections, write it down and think about the answers to these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long have you noticed it? What's the pattern?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes it worse or better — activity, diet, position, sleep, sex, foods? Have you tried heat, rest, or over-the-counter medicines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What else has changed during this time? Did you start a new job, try to lose weight, take a new dietary supplement? New soap or shampoo? New partner?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What would you say to women who are embarrassed to go to the gynecologist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, it's embarrassing. That being said, we do a lot of uncomfortable and embarrassing things that are good for us. At the end of the day, most women will realize that it's not as bad as they thought it would be and they feel better knowing everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
I even pat myself on the back after I go to the gynecologist. Mammograms, too. I hate doing it, but I think "Phew. I've taken care of myself."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: What about asking questions that make them uncomfortable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We've seen it all. We don't take it home. If you feel nervous about asking something, write it down before you come in. If you put it in writing, you've already faced it and you can just read it to me. I learn the most from listening to the patient and getting her history, which can then help inform the physical exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: What are the topics you think all women should cover with their gynecologists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It depends on your life stage, but bleeding patterns are important at every age. For anyone menstruating, keep a menstrual calendar. When we ask for your LMP or last menstrual period, we want to know the first day and not the last day. Know that answer before you walk in the door. If you're menopausal, let us know if you've had any bleeding, spotting, or brown or bloody discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
Tell us about any changes that are out of the ordinary. Keep in mind that it may be different for you, but it can still be normal. Our bodies change as we age, so patterns may change. Something may be different for you, but it's up to me to figure out if it's abnormal. If you're concerned about something, make an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do you tell your patients who are going through perimenopause and menopause?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Hopefully, your mom tells you about your first menstrual period, but unfortunately, she may not tell you about the last. Menopause shares commonalities with adolescence — the irregular cycles and the mood swings. But instead of teenage acne, there are hot flashes, wrinkles, and changes in body shape. No wonder we have so many questions.&lt;/p&gt;
Menopause is officially one year after the last menstrual period and typically happens between 40 and 55 years old. Perimenopause is the time leading up to the last period.&lt;/p&gt;
My first suggestion is, again, keep good menstrual records. There are apps available. Then get educated. I recommend &lt;a href="http://www.menopause.org/for-women" target="_blank" title="Menopause Information, About Menopause  | The North American Menopause Society, NAMS"&gt;The North American Menopause Society's website&lt;/a&gt;. Most women tolerate the changes with nothing more than reassurance. But for some women, hormone replacement therapy may be a safe and very helpful option, or non-hormonal options may be better. A trip to the gynecologist can help you decide whether treatment of menopausal symptoms is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: What questions do you wish women would ask you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It depends on her age, but if someone wants to be a mom, we should talk about the things she needs to consider. If she doesn't want to be a parent anytime soon, same thing. Let's talk about the things she needs to consider, so she can get pregnant when she wants, instead of getting pregnant and then deciding what to do. Planned pregnancies are healthier pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;
If there is any chance you could get pregnant, no matter how unlikely, you should consider yourself at high risk for pregnancy. This means choosing a modern, safe, effective &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/birth-control-methods.html" title="Birth control methods fact sheet | womenshealth.gov"&gt;birth control method&lt;/a&gt; that is right for you. You also need to take multivitamins with folic acid and refrain from using alcohol and other toxins and environmental hazards, because if you get pregnant, you want to have already cut back on potentially harmful substances your baby may be exposed to. You want to do this before pregnancy, not just after a positive pregnancy test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: Let's talk about Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). What are your top tips for prevention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Abstinence is great for prevention. But abstinence doesn't just mean abstaining from intercourse. It means abstaining from intimate contact. Unfortunately, abstinence is often ineffective — let's call it user error. For couples who are sexually active and don't use a form of contraception, they have about an 85% chance of experiencing a pregnancy over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;
Many &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/sexually-transmitted-infections.html" title="Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) | womenshealth.gov"&gt;STIs&lt;/a&gt; like HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea can be prevented with latex or silicone &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-aids/preventing-hiv-infection/practice-safer-sex.html#mc" title="Male condom | womenshealth.gov"&gt;condoms&lt;/a&gt;. But herpes, HPV, and crabs are spread through any skin-to-skin contact. You can use condoms, but they don't cover the shaft of the penis or the vulva, so to prevent those you would want to use a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-aids/preventing-hiv-infection/practice-safer-sex.html#fc" title="Female condom"&gt;female condom&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
Also, know your partner. Ask your partner to get tested. Have that talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: We know periods can be uncomfortable, but if you're experiencing pain, what's the best way to talk to your doctor about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Most women experience some menstrual pain or other symptoms at some point in their lives. For most women, an over-the-counter medication can relieve the pain. If that doesn't work, some hormonal birth control methods can help. For some women, exercise can reduce cramps.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk to your doctor if you can't work through your pain and if it's recurrent. Watch it over time — what makes it worse and what makes it better. Sometimes menstrual pain is the sign of an underlying disorder, such as &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/endometriosis.html" title="Endometriosis | womenshealth.gov"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/uterine-fibroids.html" title="Uterine fibroids fact sheet | womenshealth.gov"&gt;fibroids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Making Strides Toward an AIDS-free Generation</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/making-strides-aids-free</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Making Strides Toward an AIDS-free Generation&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ed. note: This blog is cross-posted from the HHS.gov blog. The original post date was December 1, 2015. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/blog/2015/12/01/world-aids-day-making-strides-toward-aids-free-generation.html" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.hhs.gov/blog/2015/12/01/world-aids-day-making-strides-toward-aids-free-generation.html'); return false;" title="Making a Difference for National Hispanic Heritage Month | HHS.gov"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the original post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell" class="alignright" height="400" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2015/04/secretary-burwell-post.jpg" width="320" /&gt;On the first World AIDS Day in 1988, people living with HIV/AIDS faced an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;
On average, those with AIDS lived only 19 to 30 months after their diagnosis. They had very few treatment options. And in the United States, many couldn't get the medical care they needed because insurance companies could deny them coverage due to their "pre–existing condition."&lt;/p&gt;
Today, we have a lot of progress to celebrate. On the 28th World AIDS Day, someone diagnosed with HIV soon after infection who gets appropriate care and consistent treatment can expect to live a nearly normal lifespan. Treatment can even reduce the risk of transmitting the virus by up to 96%. And no American can be denied health coverage because of a pre-existing condition.&lt;/p&gt;
We have even more work to do, though, and that's why our theme for World AIDS Day 2015 is &lt;em&gt;The Time to Act is Now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
As we push forward the frontiers of medicine, we've discovered new prevention options. If you are at risk for acquiring HIV, you can talk to a healthcare professional about taking pre-exposure prophylaxis, or &lt;a href="https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/prevention/reduce-your-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis/index.html" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/prevention/reduce-your-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis/index.html'); return false;" title="PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PrEP)"&gt;PrEP&lt;/a&gt;, a daily pill that dramatically lowers the possibility of infection. And there are even more breakthroughs on the way. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health, together with private-sector partners, are building new tools that will help us prevent and treat HIV even better in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
But these breakthroughs in prevention and treatment can only save the lives of people who can access them. That's why the Affordable Care Act is so important. Since provisions of the law have taken effect, an estimated 17.6 million Americans have found health coverage, helping us reach the lowest levels of uninsured in our nation's history. The law has made health coverage more affordable for families and for taxpayers. And families across our country, including families with a loved one living with HIV/AIDS, can rest a little easier knowing that they can't be dropped from their health coverage because they get sick or discriminated against if they have a pre-existing condition.&lt;/p&gt;
If you or a loved one lives with HIV and needs health coverage, now is the time to get covered. The Health Insurance Marketplace is open for business!&lt;/p&gt;

People are available to help, whether in person or over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
Open Enrollment runs until the end of January, but if you need coverage that starts January 1st, you need to sign up by December 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
This World AIDS Day, let's reflect on the many people we've lost to HIV/AIDS and the many lives we can save in the years to come. We're making strides toward an AIDS-free generation with our &lt;a href="https://www.aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-update/index.html" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-update/index.html'); return false;" title="National HIV/AIDS Strategy: Updated to 2020"&gt;National HIV/AIDS Strategy: Updated to 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and a new &lt;img alt="PDF - Requires Adobe Acrobat Reader" border="0" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/resources/acrobat.png" title="PDF - Requires Adobe Acrobat Reader" /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-2020-action-plan.pdf" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-2020-action-plan.pdf'); return false;" title="PDF - National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States: Updated to 2020"&gt;Federal Action Plan&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 772 KB) that will guide our efforts across the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

But we can't do this alone. We need everyone to be involved. That starts with you.&lt;/p&gt;
Do you know your HIV status? If you don't, please get tested. You can use AIDS.gov's &lt;a href="https://locator.aids.gov/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://locator.aids.gov/'); return false;" title="Find HIV Testing Sites &amp; Care Services"&gt;HIV Testing Sites &amp; Care Services Locator&lt;/a&gt;. And thanks to the Affordable Care Act, most healthcare plans offer HIV testing without any co-pay or deductible.&lt;/p&gt;
If you are living with the virus, health insurance can help you get the right treatment. And if you're shopping for coverage, you can check health plans for their specific coverage, like prescriptions, that can affect your costs and your care. For more information on your options for health coverage, visit &lt;a href="http://1.usa.gov/1M6zxd0" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'Healthcare.gov http://1.usa.gov/1M6zxd0'); return false;" title="Get 2016 health coverage starting November 1, 2015. Health Insurance Marketplace | HealthCare.gov"&gt;HealthCare.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
Over the course of these 28 World AIDS Days, we've made some great strides. With your help, we can keep up the pace toward a generation that's truly AIDS-free.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Stop STIs: Six Steps to Safer Sex</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/6-steps-safer-sex</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Stop STIs: Six Steps to Safer Sex&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="A couple close together" class="alignright" height="285" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2015/04/6-steps-post.jpg" width="400" /&gt;Whether you call them sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), one thing is true: Women are at risk of infection. Not only does a woman's anatomy make her vulnerable to STIs, women are less likely to have symptoms than men. Untreated STIs can lead to serious health issues, including infertility, cancer, and even death. It's not fun to think about, but protecting yourself from STIs like genital herpes, genital warts, chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIV is an important part of staying healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
Here are six ways to protect yourself from STIs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the facts.&lt;/strong&gt; About 20 million new STIs occur in the United States every year, affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. Many STIs are spread through intimate sexual contact, but you don't have to have vaginal or anal sex to be at risk — some common STIs are spread easily by oral sex and genital touching. And because many STIs have only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, you can't tell by looking at someone whether or not they have an infection. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/sexually-transmitted-infections.html"&gt;Know the STI basics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to your partner.&lt;/strong&gt; It's important to talk with your partner about STIs and practicing safe sex &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you have sex. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-aids/preventing-hiv-infection/practice-safer-sex.html#b"&gt;Get tips for talking with your partner&lt;/a&gt;, and set the ground rules together. Also, don't assume you're at low risk for STIs if you have sex with only one partner at a time. That person may be having sex with others.
If you have been forced, pressured, or coerced into having sexual contact without protection, &lt;a href="https://rainn.org/get-help/national-sexual-assault-hotline" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://rainn.org/get-help/national-sexual-assault-hotline'); return false;"&gt;there are people who can help you&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone deserves to be in control of their own health, including their sexual health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get tested.&lt;/strong&gt; It's important to know whether or not you have an infection — to make sure it's treated quickly and to avoid spreading it to others. If you are infected, you can take steps to protect yourself and your partner(s). Many STIs can be easily diagnosed and treated, and under the Affordable Care Act, &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/#part=2" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/#part=2'); return false;"&gt;STI prevention, screening, and counseling services&lt;/a&gt; are fully covered by most insurance plans, at no cost to you. Talk to your health care provider at your &lt;a href="http://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/everyday-healthy-living/sexual-health/get-your-well-woman-visit-every-year" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/everyday-healthy-living/sexual-health/get-your-well-woman-visit-every-year'); return false;"&gt;annual well-woman visit&lt;/a&gt; about which &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/screeningReccs.htm" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/screeningReccs.htm'); return false;"&gt;STIs tests&lt;/a&gt; you might need.
&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/hiv/stdfact-std-hiv.htm" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/std/hiv/stdfact-std-hiv.htm'); return false;"&gt;Having an STI can also increase your risk for getting HIV.&lt;/a&gt; The same behaviors and situations that put you at risk for STIs also put you at increased risk for getting HIV. Plus, some types of STIs may cause sores or breaks in your skin that make HIV transmission easier. If you test positive for an STI, you should also &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-aids/get-tested-for-hiv/"&gt;get tested for HIV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice monogamy.&lt;/strong&gt; This means being in a sexual relationship with only one partner who is also faithful to you. Make sure you've both been tested for STIs and know each other's results. Condoms should be used with any partner outside of a long-term, monogamous sexual relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use condoms.&lt;/strong&gt; Use a condom correctly every time you have anal, vaginal, or oral sex to reduce the risk of STI transmission. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-aids/preventing-hiv-infection/practice-safer-sex.html#mc"&gt;Get tips for using male and female condoms correctly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get vaccinated.&lt;/strong&gt; Safe and effective vaccines are available to help prevent the spread of the human papillomavirus (HPV). While it's recommended for kids who are 11 or 12, young women can receive the series of shots through the age of 26. HPV vaccines can help protect you from the types of HPV that cause most cervical cancers. Vaccines for HPV are covered as &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/'); return false;"&gt;preventive services&lt;/a&gt; under the Affordable Care Act, which means most insurers must cover them at no cost to you. Learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/human-papillomavirus.html"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt;, then talk to your doctor about whether the vaccines are right for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, taking steps to protect yourself is easier than ever. Most insurers must cover STI screening, counseling, and HPV vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/'); return false;"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; at no cost to you, even if you haven't met your yearly deductible.&lt;/p&gt;
If you think you may have been exposed to infection, get tested right away. The sooner you get a diagnosis, the sooner you can start treatment and reduce the risk of spreading it to others. &lt;a href="http://hivtest.cdc.gov/STDTesting.aspx" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://hivtest.cdc.gov/STDTesting.aspx'); return false;"&gt;Find a testing site near you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
Remember, it's your body. By taking steps to protect yourself, you can lower your risk for STIs. Please share this important reminder with the teen girls and women in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Stepping Out of the Shadows, Together for Women &amp; Girls</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/stepping-out-shadows</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Stepping Out of the Shadows, Together for Women &amp; Girls&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ed. note: This blog is cross-posted from the &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/03/10/stepping-out-shadows-together-women-and-girls" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/03/10/stepping-out-shadows-together-women-and-girls'); return false;" title="White House Blog"&gt;The White House Blog&lt;/a&gt;. The original post date was March 10, 2015. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Red awareness ribbon" class="alignright" height="300" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2015/03/stepping-out-of-shadows-post.jpg" width="300" /&gt;Today, the Office of National AIDS Policy, Office of the Vice President, and the White House Council on Women and Girls commemorate the 10th observance of &lt;a href="https://www.aids.gov/news-and-events/awareness-days/women-and-girls/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.aids.gov/news-and-events/awareness-days/women-and-girls/'); return false;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Women &amp; Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Along with other federal, national, and community organizations and advocates, today we celebrate our accomplishments to date in improving the lives of women and girls affected by HIV and recognize the work still ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
Our observance highlights the strides we have made in HIV prevention and care for women and girls across the United States. The introduction of antiretroviral drugs means that fewer women die from AIDS and pregnant women have reliable means by which to protect their babies from the virus. In fact, rates of mother-to-child transmission continue to fall, despite more women with HIV giving birth. Under the Affordable Care Act, new health plans are now required to cover HIV screening without cost sharing, for everyone aged 15 to 65, pregnant women, and others who may be at increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/ipv/13_243567_green_aag-a.pdf" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/ipv/13_243567_green_aag-a.pdf'); return false;"&gt;But our work is far from over&lt;/a&gt;: Today, only about half of women living with HIV receive medical treatment, and only 2 in 5 have achieved viral suppression. Women face unique challenges and barriers to care, not the least of which is violence. Sexual assault and intimate partner violence (IPV) dramatically affect women's access to HIV prevention and treatment. IPV, which often includes forced sex, increases a woman's risk of contracting HIV and reduces her ability to demand prevention measures such as monogamy and condom use. In fact, women in abusive relationships have four times the risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, than women in non-abusive relationships. Women in abusive relationships may delay testing and treatment out of fear of violence, and those who have been forced to have sex are less likely to ever have been tested for HIV. Women living with HIV who experience violence also have four times the rate of antiretroviral failure, compromising their long-term health even further.&lt;/p&gt;
Women who are HIV-positive are also at a higher risk of physical violence. Fifty-five percent of women living with HIV face intimate partner violence, double the national rate, and they risk provoking an abusive partner if they share their positive status.&lt;/p&gt;
It is easy to dismiss these as problems of other women, or other people. But they are issues that affect us all. Women from all walks of life are at risk — our mothers, sisters, daughters, nieces, friends, and coworkers. If we are to empower women to protect their health no matter their HIV status, we must address women's unique HIV and IPV risks with targeted research and policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
That's why in 2012, President Obama signed a &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/30/presidential-memorandum-establishing-working-group-intersection-hivaids-" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/30/presidential-memorandum-establishing-working-group-intersection-hivaids-'); return false;"&gt;Presidential Memorandum&lt;/a&gt; establishing a federal interagency working group to begin addressing the intersection of these overlapping epidemics. Last October, we released the &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/hiv_vaw_grhd_report.pdf" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/hiv_vaw_grhd_report.pdf'); return false;"&gt;first annual update&lt;/a&gt; of implementation progress, and today we are proud to announce new actions by both federal agencies and community organizations to implement our recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have collaborated to support a $9 million interagency agreement to fund transitional housing for women living with HIV who may be experiencing violence. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/4437/fr-5853-n-01-notice-of-intent-to-conduct-a-vawa-and-hopwa-project-demonstration" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/4437/fr-5853-n-01-notice-of-intent-to-conduct-a-vawa-and-hopwa-project-demonstration'); return false;"&gt;DOJ and HUD announced the release&lt;/a&gt; of the federal notice for comment for these new grant opportunities that will be available later this spring.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HHS Office of Adolescent Health &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/grants/2015%20FOAs/2015-hivctr-foa-info.html" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/grants/2015%20FOAs/2015-hivctr-foa-info.html'); return false;"&gt;has issued a new funding opportunity&lt;/a&gt; to support the launch of a national HIV/AIDS resource center that will provide innovative HIV prevention efforts for teens and adolescents. The new resource center will promote the implementation of evidence-based best practices targeted to adolescent youth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.thehotline.org/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.thehotline.org/'); return false;"&gt;National Domestic Violence Hotline&lt;/a&gt;, funded by the HHS Administration for Children and Families (ACF), announced the results of their recent survey of users of their service, on knowledge of HIV risk factors, recent HIV testing, and knowledge about HIV services and resources — data that will inform gaps in knowledge among the community about the intersection of HIV and violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Institute on Domestic Violence in the African American Community (IDVAAC), which has also received funding from ACF, announced its commitment to convene four regional roundtables in high-HIV—prevalence neighborhoods to bring together leaders in the domestic violence and HIV fields in the local African-American community to discuss, in conjunction with the local department of health, how HIV and domestic violence silos can be broken down at the local level for women at highest risk. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;Now we ask that you join us by becoming part of a community that stands together to improve the lives of all women in the United States. Together, we will continue supporting women and girls, fighting for their right to health, safety, and well-being, and moving toward the goal of an AIDS-free generation.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Life After an AIDS Diagnosis</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/life-after-aids</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Life After an AIDS Diagnosis&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Martha Sichone Cameron and her family" class="alignright" height="287" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2015/03/life-after-aids-post.jpg" width="425" /&gt;I don't think anything can prepare you for the moment when they unveil the piece of paper that contains your fate. Even though the odds seemed to be against me, I was not prepared to be told I had HIV. Turns out, the doctor had worse news: It was actually an AIDS diagnosis and the doctor gave me 3 to 6 months to live.&lt;/p&gt;
Almost 12 years year later, I look back and can still feel the hopelessness after hearing the news. I was in disbelief of what seemed inevitable. By that time in my life, I had lost many family members to AIDS. I was born and raised in Zambia, and it felt like we lost a generation to AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
The support and encouragement of family, faith leaders, and colleagues saw me through the sickness, depression, and stigma that came with the diagnosis. Thankfully, I received life-saving medication and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Life after my diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I met my husband when he visited Zambia on a mission trip. I still think he is crazy for falling in love with me, and he thinks I am crazy for marrying him. I guess we are crazy in love. The acceptance that I have found in my husband and his family is a miracle in itself. I had given up all hope of getting married because of my status, so the acceptance that I found in my husband and his family feels like a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
We both knew we wanted children, but it was a scary prospect. There were so many "what ifs," including the thought that I might not be able to see my child grow up.&lt;/p&gt;
We went out of our way to find and work with a doctor who could help us prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV and perform a C-section to ensure the health of our child.&lt;/p&gt;
My first son was born HIV-free in 2009. We had a second son in 2011. Both my sons and my husband remain HIV-negative.&lt;/p&gt;
My life feels like a miracle, but it's also just as crazy as everyone else's. My life is all about kindergarten, music lessons, birthday parties, Christmas, Transformers Rescue Bots, and Power Rangers. Other than taking two antiretroviral (HIV medication) pills at bedtime — a drastic change from taking six to 10 pills twice a day — my life as a working mum is practically normal.&lt;/p&gt;
Today, I work with an organization providing direct services to women of color who are living with or at increased risk of HIV in the Washington, D.C., metro area.&lt;/p&gt;
I believe I have a responsibility to educate women and create awareness about HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. I want all women living with HIV/AIDS to have an opportunity to access care and, should they desire, to find love and start a family. You, too, can have an HIV-negative child.&lt;/p&gt;
I know that education and awareness will help reduce stigma, too. I hope that by sharing my story, I can help others realize that HIV/AIDS doesn't define you. I may be a woman living with AIDS, but more importantly, I am a mother, wife, and advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Join Martha and be part of a community that stands together to fight HIV/AIDS — learn how you can support &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwghaad/" title="NWGHAAD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Domestic Violence: A Provider Perspective</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/dv-provider-perspective</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Domestic Violence: A Provider Perspective&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="doctor with female patient" class="alignleft" height="171" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/assets/images/blog/2014/10/dvproviders_post-300x171.jpg" width="300" /&gt;October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month — an important time to increase awareness of this public health issue. Domestic violence or interpersonal violence (IPV) can have a profound impact on the health, safety, and well-being of women and men, children, and other family members. According to national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one in three women and one in four men in the United States have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetimes. IPV is also connected with chronic health issues, HIV/AIDS, and is made worse by other high-risk behavioral issues, including substance abuse and mental health issues. Members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community may also experience IPV in their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
Identifying current or past abusive and traumatic experiences can help prevent further abuse, lessen disability, and lead to improved health status. Because health care providers are often trusted resources in their communities, they are in a unique position to connect individuals who experience IPV with supportive local services. It is critically important to take the time to ask whether patients feel safe in their relationships and to listen to what is said and recognize what is not said, as well as watch the person's reaction to this question. Providing patients with information, resources, and referrals to community-based organizations for further assistance, if needed, can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, most health insurance plans now cover screening and brief counseling for domestic and IPV for women. The health care law also requires most plans to cover screening and counseling for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections at no additional cost. Learn what other services are covered under the HRSA &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/'); return false;"&gt;women's preventive services guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Additional &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/preventive-care-benefits/women/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/preventive-care-benefits/women/'); return false;"&gt;women's preventive services&lt;/a&gt; are available at no additional cost, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/preventive-care-benefits/adults/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'https://www.healthcare.gov/preventive-care-benefits/adults/'); return false;"&gt;preventive services for all adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
There are also resources you can share with your patients to help prevent violence before it happens. For example, &lt;a href="http://www.circleof6app.com/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.circleof6app.com/'); return false;"&gt;Circle of 6&lt;/a&gt; is a free mobile app that makes it easy for a woman to reach six friends if she is in a situation that makes her uncomfortable or if she needs help.&lt;/p&gt;
Remind women that no one has the right to hurt them or make them feel afraid. If you suspect that one of your patients feels unsafe, let them know they can call the National Violence Hotline at 800-799-SAFE (7233) or 800-787-3224 (TDD) to talk to someone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and the call is free and confidential. Your patients can also chat with a trained advocate at the &lt;a href="http://www.thehotline.org/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links-Blog', 'http://www.thehotline.org/'); return false;"&gt;National Domestic Violence Hotline&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;

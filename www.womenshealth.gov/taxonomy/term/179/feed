  <description>&lt;span&gt;Sloane Stephens on Living Her Healthiest Life&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Taking steps for better health is not always easy. Professional athletes sometimes need a little extra motivation! As a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwhw"&gt;National Women’s Health Week ambassador&lt;/a&gt;, tennis champion Sloane Stephens shares how she builds healthy behaviors into her life. In this blog post, Sloane talks about getting motivated on tough days, making healthy food choices, and staying fit off the tennis court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What inspires you to be healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I want to be able to live a long life that includes being active, traveling, and keeping up with my family. Being my best and healthiest self allows me to enjoy the things that I love most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;On days when you are not feeling motivated, how do you help yourself get going?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Some days I wake up and I do not want to work out or play tennis. That is normal. I like to give myself little rewards for accomplishing those things when I need to. I tell myself, “OK, after practice I can go treat myself to some frozen yogurt or a movie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;When you are not playing tennis, what are your favorite ways to stay fit?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I enjoy gym workouts, beach walks, and the occasional spin or yoga class. I like to mix things up and challenge my body with new activities so that I do not get bored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Do you have any advice for making healthy food choices when you are traveling or dining out?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;It is all about balance. Choose healthy foods that make you feel good. There are definitely foods I know I have to avoid because I will be tired or feel bad after I eat them. Learning what works for your body and listening to it is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What is your favorite healthy snack?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Peanuts! I travel everywhere with a bag of them. They are easy to eat on the go, which is perfect for me since I travel a ton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What is your advice for making time for self-care, and how do you like to de-stress?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Again, I think it is important to listen to your body. If I had a long day or am just tired, I know not to push myself and make plans. I go home, take a bath, light candles, and just relax. Having no plans and just being with my family is the best way to really de-stress for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What are your go-to tips for getting good sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I am a big fan of diffusers. I like to use lavender to help me unwind and sleep well. Also, exercise helps me sleep. I noticed that I always sleep better when I get to work out that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Do you have advice on making your annual checkup with your doctor and actually keeping the appointment?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I like to keep all of my annual appointments at the same time every year. I schedule them when I know I will have some downtime so work or other commitments do not cause me to cancel or reschedule. Plus, it is easy to remember my appointments if they are all around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>HHS Women Leaders Celebrate National Women’s Health Week</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/hhs-women-celebrate-nwhw</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;HHS Women Leaders Celebrate National Women’s Health Week&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Your health is a lifelong journey and it is unique to you. We all have our own reasons for wanting to be healthy and ways of going about it. Taking small steps for your health can make a big difference over time! This &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwhw"&gt;National Women’s Health Week&lt;/a&gt;, we are encouraging women to reflect on their health and share how they make healthy habits part of their everyday lives. Below, a few women leaders here at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services share how they find their health, why women should prioritize their health, and how their work is helping women lead healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Dr. Dorothy Fink" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/bio_dorothy-fink.jpg" style="float: left; width: 115px; height: 144px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dorothy Fink, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women's Health and Director, Office on Women's Health, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
“National Women’s Health Week is about taking &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwhw/about"&gt;steps to achieve better health&lt;/a&gt;. Finding my health means taking time to reach my health goals and taking the advice that I give my patients and family! This year, my goal is to work on upper body muscle strength. It feels great to see progress with my core strength and to lift progressively heavier dumbbells. I am also trying to make sure that I eat enough foods with calcium every day. Calcium is essential for human life and many of us do not eat enough calcium through food. It is well known that calcium makes our bones strong, but it also makes our heart and muscles contract. I am determined to eat enough calcium through food every day. National Women’s Health Week is also a time to think about preventive screening and vaccines with your health care provider. We encourage women to figure out if they (or their family or friends) are due for the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html" title="Measles | Vaccination | CDC"&gt;MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella."&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Kaveeta P. Vasisht, M.D., Pharm.D. " src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-kaveeta-vasisht.jpg" style="float: left; width: 115px; height: 144px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaveeta P. Vasisht, M.D., Pharm.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Acting Associate Commissioner and Deputy Director, Office of Women’s Health, Office of the Commissioner, U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
“Finding my health means maintaining my physical and mental well-being. This can include taking a challenging fitness class with a friend, making creative healthy meals with my family, getting lost in a captivating novel, and engaging in a few minutes of daily mindfulness.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pattie Tucker, M.P.H., Dr.P.H." src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-pattie-tucker.jpg" style="float: left; width: 115px; height: 159px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pattie Tucker, M.P.H., Dr.P.H.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Director for the Office of Women’s Health, Office of Minority Health and Health Equity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
“The majority of caregivers are women. They are our mothers, grandmothers, wives, daughters, sisters, and nieces who unselfishly put the needs of others over their own needs. If you are that woman, take time today to find your health. Make your physical, mental, and emotional well-being your number one priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="Camille Fabiyi, Ph.D., M.P.H." src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-camille-fabiyi.jpg" style="float: left; width: 115px; height: 150px;" /&gt;Camille Fabiyi, Ph.D., M.P.H.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Senior Advisor for Women’s Health and Gender Research, Office of Extramural Research, Education and Priority Populations, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
“It’s important that women not only take time for themselves, but that communities support women’s health and health care across the entire life course. Finding my health includes taking time to center myself and engage in activities and interactions that bring me joy and peace, such as running outdoors, getting proper rest, and spending quality time with family and friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Janine Austin Clayton, M.D." src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-janine-austin-clayton.jpg" style="float: left; width: 115px; height: 152px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janine Austin Clayton, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associate Director for Research on Women’s Health and Director of the Office of Research on Women’s Health, National Institutes of Health &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
“At the Office of Research on Women’s Health, our mission is to enhance research on conditions affecting women, ensure that women are represented in research, and promote the advancement of women in biomedical careers. ‘Women’s health’ was once synonymous with reproductive health. Today, scientists recognize that the ‘health of women’ encompasses all medical conditions. Forward-looking research must consider the intersecting factors of sex and gender, race/ethnicity, social determinants of health, and other influences, harnessing the expertise of many fields.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Sabrina Matoff-Stepp, Ph.D." src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-sabrina-matoff-stepp.jpg" style="float: left; width: 115px; height: 143px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabrina Matoff-Stepp, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Director, Office of Women’s Health, Health Resources and Services Administration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
“Finding my health means I am taking time each day to center and reflect in a quiet space. As a leader, mentor, and colleague at the Health Resources and Services Administration, I am inspired by the important roles that women of all ages play in their families and communities and how all of us can make a difference.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>OWH Director: How I Make My Health a Priority</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/make-health-priority</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;OWH Director: How I Make My Health a Priority&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;The 20th annual &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwhw"&gt;National Women’s Health Week&lt;/a&gt; is here! I am thrilled to be part of the celebration this year as the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/about-us/who-we-are/leadership/dr-dorothy-fink"&gt;new director&lt;/a&gt; of the Office on Women’s Health. As a practicing physician, I have been focused on women and girls’ health issues my entire career and am excited to bring my knowledge to this role and continue to help women and girls achieve the best possible health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Dorothy Fink, M.D." src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/bio_dorothy-fink.jpg" style="float: right; width: 350px; height: 438px;" /&gt;National Women’s Health Week is about taking &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwhw/about"&gt;steps to achieve better health&lt;/a&gt;, such as visiting a health care provider for a checkup and talking about what screenings and vaccines you may need, including the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html" title="CDC - Measles: Vaccination"&gt;MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella; getting plenty of physical activity; eating healthy foods; paying attention to your mental health; and practicing safe behaviors, like not texting and driving. Even though these steps are essential for good health, I think most of us can agree that it is not always easy to build them into our daily lives. Sure, we know these steps can help us feel our best and prevent serious diseases and conditions, like heart disease and diabetes, but sometimes it is hard to get motivated or stay on track, especially when we have so many other responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
Also, what works for one woman may not work for another. Each one of us is unique — we all have different goals, different motivations and reasons for getting or staying healthy, and different ways of achieving our health goals. The key to building healthy habits into our lives is to find what works for us as individuals. We want to help you do that during National Women’s Health Week! Here are some steps to uncover ways to be healthier every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflect on your health.&lt;/strong&gt; Health is a lifelong journey, and it certainly is not a straight line. There are stops along the way, forks in the road, and sometimes, your destination changes as you evolve and change. With my new work schedule, I have been reflecting on my health journey — thinking about where I am right now and where I want to go. I have thought about questions like these: Why do I want to be healthy? What am I already doing to lead a healthy life? What do I want to improve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="rteindent1"&gt;What I realized is that I am motivated by my desire to have a strong and healthy body for life. One of the activities I want to work on is making strength training a bigger part of my daily routine because healthy muscles and strong bones are so important for all women and girls. They help us do important everyday tasks and maintain good posture. My patients truly inspire me when it comes to improving muscle strength. Yes, it is important to figure out a fitness routine that gets you moving — anything from dancing to walking to swimming to running — but muscle strength is just as important. I have taken care of too many patients with &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000443.htm" title="Compression fractures of the back: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia"&gt;compression fractures&lt;/a&gt; of their spines who could have benefited from stronger back muscles. Think about adding some dumbbells to your fitness routine! Try committing to 10 minutes a day of physical activity. Small steps can make a big difference over time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="rteindent1"&gt;This National Women’s Health Week, I encourage you to try reflecting on your health, too! Take a pulse check on your health to see where you are and where you want to go from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set manageable goals and take small steps.&lt;/strong&gt; You have heard it before, but simple steps can make a big difference in your health. Drastic changes can be overwhelming and tough to maintain. That is why I opt to get creative when possible! I look for timesavers and small ways to work toward my goals throughout the day. For example, using a slow cooker can save time if you love the smell of food cooking when you arrive home. My goal is to try one new recipe a month, so by the end of the year that is 12 new recipes for my collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="rteindent1"&gt;Another strategy is preparing meals on the weekends. I have had many patients make dramatic improvements to their health by preparing meals on the weekends for the week ahead. Additionally, having food ready to eat after a busy day can help prevent you from eating late at night, which can impact your blood glucose levels. Many of my patients living with diabetes would show me their blood glucose levels the morning after eating late at night, and their glucose levels were often higher compared to when they ate earlier in the evening. Our bodies need time to metabolize food. Going to bed on a full stomach makes it harder for our bodies to metabolize what we ate for dinner. Eating before 8 p.m. and walking after meals are small steps you can take to improve your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="rteindent1"&gt;Ask yourself about the different reasons why it might be hard for you to focus on a particular area of your health. Once you know what your challenges are, you can create a plan to overcome your obstacles step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about what is most important to you.&lt;/strong&gt; My family and friends are a key part of my health. One of my motivating factors for taking care of myself is that I need to maintain my health so that I can be there for my family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="rteindent1"&gt;Healthy relationships are integral to good health. It can be challenging when relatives are not in the same city as you, but it makes it all the more important to talk with them frequently and plan visits. Even during busy weeks, I try to call my grandma because talking with her always reminds me of what matters most in my life. One of my grandfather’s friends from World War II is 99 years old! Staying in contact with him over the years has reminded me to be active. (He continued to jog into his 90s and still does an occasional 5K race!) We are planning to visit him this summer and I cannot wait to listen to more stories about his time with my grandfather during WWII and the years since then. It is sad to talk about for sure, but in health care, we know how &lt;a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/enews/past-issues/2019/january-17/loneliness-epidemic" title="The " loneliness="" epidemic="" official="" web="" site="" of="" the="" u.s.="" health="" resources="" services="" administration=""&gt;loneliness impacts health&lt;/a&gt;. Think about how you can put a smile on someone’s face by letting them know you care about them. You may very well find that your heart smiles in return. &lt;/p&gt;
Building healthy habits into your life takes practice, and all we can do is learn as we go. Hopefully, pausing to reflect on your health, finding simple tweaks you can make to your routine, and thinking about what is most important to you will help you take the next step on your health journey. If you are not sure where to start, we can help. Please use&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwhw/find-your-health"&gt; our online tool&lt;/a&gt; to explore where you are and where you want to go. Based on your responses, you will receive &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwhw/find-your-health"&gt;personalized tips&lt;/a&gt; so you can start working toward your next healthy destination today!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>OWH Resolutions: Where Are They Now?</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/owh-2018-resolutions-revisited</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;OWH Resolutions: Where Are They Now?&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Did you make a New Year’s resolution in 2018? If so, how’d it go? Did you meet your goal, or do you have more work to do? Reflecting on your progress may bring on a range of emotions. Whether you’re feeling proud or discouraged, that’s OK. Sometimes we accomplish our goals the first time, and sometimes it takes longer than we expect. The key is to stick with it! Just ask my colleagues. Last year around this time, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/owh-2018-resolutions"&gt;I asked some of them to share their plans&lt;/a&gt; for improving their health and well-being in 2018. As the year is coming to a close, I asked them to give us an update. Here’s what they had to say:&lt;img alt="Image of a woman with her arms triumphantly in the air." src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-owh-resolutions-reflections.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooke says: &lt;/strong&gt;For the first few months of 2018, I stuck with my goal of meditating regularly in order to feel less stressed. I think it worked so well that I stopped meditating! But then, like 80% of women going through &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menopause/menopause-basics/#2"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;, hot flashes started waking me up at night. So, in October, I began meditating again with my app during lunchtime. While there isn’t hard evidence that meditation helps with hot flashes, it does help me feel less stressed when hot flashes happen. Life is always going to be stressful. I’m hopeful that meditation will help me react in a way that’s healthier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adrianne says: &lt;/strong&gt;I wanted to invest in my mental health by doing more things that make me smile — and wow! I’m taking cooking and Spanish classes, and they have been so much fun! I even managed a beach vacation and a short visit with my family this year. I can feel the difference in my stress levels, and my friends have noticed, too. Of course things still come up, but now I am more aware of when it’s time for me to take a break. That’s growth, and it feels great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann says:&lt;/strong&gt; My goal for 2018 was to move forward with knee replacement surgery. I have not yet accomplished that goal, but I am working toward preparing my body for it. My legs need to be stronger and my body lighter before I can proceed. To that end, I am increasing my activity level and keeping an eye on what I eat with plans to achieve my goal in 2019. I am firmly in the “work in progress” camp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emily says:&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted to eat healthier and exercise more, and I’m happy to report that I am still eating plant-based foods and feeling good. I did increase my physical activity, but that is an area that I haven’t been prioritizing recently. I plan to work on getting more exercise again this year. At this time last year, I was using a vegetable delivery service, and while I’m no longer doing that, I still eat a lot of fruits and vegetables regularly and feel very healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valerie says:&lt;/strong&gt; I made a 2018 resolution? I seriously forgot that I wanted to work on my flexibility! Realizing that I could forget so easily was an "aha" moment for me. Simply saying I’m going to do something may not work for me. So for 2019, I resolve to take my stretching routine commitment further by creating a schedule and keeping it at home where I can see it. I know I love to check the box when I’ve completed something on my to-do list, so I plan to treat my stretching schedule as a to-do item. I’m hopeful that this approach will work better for me. Wish me luck!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Now it’s your turn! Think about your resolution and whether you met your goal. If there’s room for improvement, remember that we’re all a work in progress and health is a journey. Being honest — and patient — with yourself is a great first step. It can help you come up with new ideas and solutions to help you meet your goal in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Healthy Cooking Tips Around the Holidays</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/healthy-holiday-cooking-tips</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Healthy Cooking Tips Around the Holidays&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;The holidays often bring delicious meals and treats, and it can be tough to eat healthy with so much good food around. Rather than skipping or cutting out your favorite dishes, why not try making a few small changes to your recipes to cook up healthier versions? We talked to Anjali Shah, a food blogger who runs &lt;a href="https://pickyeaterblog.com/" title="The Picky Eater - A Healthy Food Blog"&gt;The Picky Eater&lt;/a&gt;. She wants to make healthy eating easy and fun. See her ideas and simple tricks for healthier cooking this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;November 27, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;When it comes to favorite family recipes, do you have any tricks for swapping in healthier ingredients?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Yes! I’ll start with an easy one — I always choose whole grains instead of white grains. So, I use whole-wheat pasta (or, alternatively, lentil pasta), brown rice instead of white rice, and whole-wheat bread instead of white bread.&lt;/p&gt;
Another thing I like to do is cut back on the cream that’s in so many holiday recipes. If I’m making a cream-based soup, I take white beans and blend them with chicken or vegetable stock. Then I add a splash of cream to it. It still makes a nice, creamy soup, but it’s not as heavy. Plus, beans are a good source of protein. &lt;/p&gt;
I also like to cut the amount of oil and butter in recipes in half. The dish still tastes really good, but it’s a little lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
My last swap is for recipes with a lot of sugar. Think about a sweet potato casserole. Sweet potatoes and some of the other ingredients are sweet on their own. I rely on their sweetness and think of sugar as an enhancer, so I use half the amount listed in the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Do you have go-to ways to work more fruits and vegetables into meals?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I like to look at a recipe and think about the colors in it. For example, mac and cheese: What are the colors? White and yellow. That’s kind of limiting if I want to build a colorful plate, so I think about the other colors I can add to it. Then, I choose the vegetables that represent those colors. In mac and cheese, I think green and orange would be nice. For orange, try pureeing butternut squash and stirring it into the dish. It’s the same with something like oatmeal. It’s white, so what other pops of color can be added? My go-to choices are berries and stone fruits like peaches, cherries, and plums.&lt;/p&gt;
For people who don’t love vegetables, pureeing different veggies is a great way to make a more wholesome dish and add important nutrients. Pureed cauliflower, which has a mild flavor, can be added to anything while helping you squeeze in more veggies. If you’re making a soup, add pureed spinach. It takes on the taste of whatever else is in the soup but packs in nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
For people who do like veggies, add a side salad to most meals or a side dish of roasted, stir-fried, or sautéed veggies with spices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;For women looking to cut back on salt, what are some alternatives they can use to season their food?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;If you can handle a little bit of spice, I like crushed red pepper or black pepper. I also like ginger and garlic. I think these help boost the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;It’s hard to imagine the holidays without dessert. Do you have tips for making sweet treats healthier? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Basically, you have to decide how healthy you want to go. There are tons of ways to make things healthier, but I see it as a spectrum. It’s as simple as saying you’re going to cut the sugar by a quarter or half. It’s not a huge change, but it means less sugar. When I reduce the sugar, I often add in vanilla, cinnamon, or nutmeg for flavor. On the other end, I sub in whole-wheat pastry flour for all-purpose flour. My baked goods are still fluffy, but again, I’m using a whole grain instead of a white grain. Another great substitute is Greek yogurt for sour cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Do you have any secrets for making healthier kid-friendly meals?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;For kids, it depends on how picky they are, but I like to start by serving a variety of vegetables and fruits with all meals. It’s good exposure. One trick I’ve found that works is to ask kids to eat the number of bites that equals their age. If they’re 5, that means 5 bites of whatever vegetable you’re serving that night.&lt;/p&gt;
For kids who will only eat bread, cheese, and pasta, pureeing fruits and vegetables is a great way to get them into more meals. At breakfast time, make pancakes with whole-grain flour and top them with apple sauce or pureed pears with mashed bananas. For lunch, make a grilled cheese on wheat bread instead of white bread. As a side, try a tomato soup, and you can add in pureed veggies like spinach or cauliflower that they won’t even notice! For dinner, try a quesadilla on whole-wheat tortillas with veggies and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;When you’re grocery shopping, do you have tips for choosing healthy options?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;If I’m buying a premade soup or broth — or anything premade — I choose the low-sodium options. If I need vegetables but need them to last longer, I buy frozen ones. But my favorite tip is to stick to the perimeter of the store. That’s usually where the fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, and protein foods like meat are sold. The middle of the store tends to have more packaged and processed foods that can be less nutritious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What’s your best advice for making cooking around the holidays less stressful? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;It might still be stressful, but trying to plan in advance can be helpful — and not just during the holidays, but year-round, too. Plan the meal or meals on one day, grocery shop for everything you need on another day, and then do the meal prep ahead of time so that things are ready to go when it’s time to start cooking. If you have family around, split up the responsibilities or get them involved so that it goes faster and is more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Your Family’s Health Is Your Health</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/family-heart-health-history</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Your Family’s Health Is Your Health&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;“How could this happen to me?”&lt;/p&gt;
This is what one of my colleagues says her mother kept saying after she found out she had &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/heart-disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nicole Greene" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-nicole-greene-headshot.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;Jane* thought she’d done everything right. Before she was diagnosed at 67, she felt like she was in the best shape of her life. She exercised daily, chose mostly healthy foods, didn’t drink or smoke, and kept her cholesterol and blood pressure under control. She felt great — until Jane experienced an unusual pressure in her chest while hiking. One of her friends had recently passed away from a heart attack, so Jane took it seriously. Luckily, so did her doctor. A series of tests found serious blockages in Jane’s &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/glossary/#arteries"&gt;arteries&lt;/a&gt;. She needed &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002950.htm" title="Open heart surgery: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia"&gt;heart surgery&lt;/a&gt;, so she underwent a triple bypass a little more than three months after that first feeling of chest pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
Jane’s diagnosis prompted most of her five siblings to see a health professional to determine their risk. Jane’s brother Tim, who had some shortness of breath, received a similar diagnosis. He also needed heart surgery and had it around the same time as Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
While both Jane and Tim are on their way to a full recovery, they and their families were caught off guard. They didn’t think they were at risk of heart disease. They both led generally healthy lives and hadn’t heard of any family history. But after their diagnoses, they learned for the first time that two of their uncles had heart disease in their 70s and 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
I wanted to share this story because it’s Family Health History Month. It’s a time to talk with your relatives about the health of your family tree. After all, if you have a close family member with a chronic disease like heart disease, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/stroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/famhistory/famhist_basics.htm" title="Basics|Family History|Genomics|CDC"&gt;you may be more likely to develop that disease yourself&lt;/a&gt;. Family history is also important if you’re planning to become pregnant. You’ll want to know whether there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/famhistory/famhist_plan_pregnancy.htm" title="Planning Pregnancy|Family History|Genomics|CDC"&gt;family history of conditions&lt;/a&gt; like birth defects and development disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
Since it’s something you can’t control, recognizing the role that your family’s health history plays in your life may feel a little scary. But knowing your family health history allows you to be proactive by reducing your risk in ways you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; control and watching for certain signs and symptoms that something might be wrong. For example, if your doctor or nurse knows that certain health issues run in your family, they can recommend smart lifestyle changes to help lower your risk. These changes might include &lt;a href="https://women.smokefree.gov/" title="Smokefree Women"&gt;quitting smoking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/healthy-eating"&gt;making healthier foods choices&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/getting-active"&gt;getting more physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. Your doctor or nurse might also recommend certain screening tests that can help catch problems early, when they are often easier to treat. But they can’t make those kinds of personalized recommendations if you don’t know your family health history.&lt;/p&gt;
The best way to understand your family health history is to talk about it with your relatives, and what better time to do that than when you’re together for the holidays? We’re here to help you prepare and collect the information you need. Try these tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with what you know. &lt;/strong&gt;Make a list of your blood relatives. That means starting with your parents, siblings, and any children you have. Then move on to your extended family, like grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and half-siblings. Once you have your list, write down any diseases and conditions you already know about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="rteindent1"&gt;If you’re adopted, you can ask your adoptive partners whether they have any medical information about your birth parents. The adoption agency also may have information available. If you have a relationship with your birth parents, you can ask them directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to your family. &lt;/strong&gt;Chat with your relatives about what they know about your family’s health history. If they don’t already know, tell them why it’s an important tool you can all use to protect your health. Ask them what they know about any relatives who have passed away. Then share with them the history you’ve compiled and ask them whether anything is missing. Some families talk well together in groups, reminding each other of relatives and illnesses they might have forgotten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask the right questions. &lt;/strong&gt;You want to know whether your relatives have any chronic diseases or conditions and if they know of any in the family (past and present). Remember, high blood pressure and cholesterol count as conditions you want to track. You also want to ask them how old they or your relatives were when they were diagnosed. Lastly, if you don’t know, ask about your family’s ancestry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organize and save your information. &lt;/strong&gt;You can organize and update your family health history information using free online tools. &lt;a href="https://phgkb.cdc.gov/FHH/html/index.html" title="My Family Health Portrait|Public Health Genomics Knowledge Base"&gt;My Family Health Portrait&lt;/a&gt; is easy to use and allows you to enter your family health history, share it with your relatives, and update it over time. The best part is that you can print it to bring to your next checkup. This will help your doctor or nurse make recommendations to help you stay healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;I know it might feel like this is just one more thing you need to do during an already busy time of year, but it can also be an opportunity to connect with your family. Health may not be something you talk about often, so you might cover new ground or discover something new (and have a chance to reminisce) about a departed loved one. Take your time and enjoy what I hope will be a rewarding journey. When you know your health history, your whole family benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Bring Your Brave</title>

  <description>&lt;span&gt;Bring Your Brave&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;I was sitting next to her as she told her story of being diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer at the age of 27. It wasn't the first time that I had heard a young woman talk through diagnosis and treatment of aggressive breast cancer, but I had to fight back tears while listening to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/young_women/bringyourbrave/stories/charity/index.htm" title="CDC - Bring Your Brave Campaign - Charity's Story"&gt;Charity&lt;/a&gt; speak. Our entire video production team was struggling not to cry. What was it about her situation that captured all of us? Was it hearing &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/young_women/bringyourbrave/stories/charity/index.htm" title="CDC - Bring Your Brave Campaign - Charity's Story"&gt;Charity&lt;/a&gt; talk about her initial doctor’s visit and being told that the lump in her breast was probably nothing? Or maybe it was hearing her say that the next time she saw a doctor about it was in the emergency room, when the cancer had eaten through her breast and she had to be hospitalized, receive several rounds of chemotherapy, and later have a non-skin sparing double mastectomy. It could have been the moments when she talked about coming to terms with infertility at such a young age. I’m not sure which part of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/young_women/bringyourbrave/stories/charity/index.htm" title="CDC - Bring Your Brave Campaign - Charity's Story"&gt;Charity’s&lt;/a&gt; story drew us in, but I do know that the experience of hearing and capturing stories like hers was a powerful experience for me and the production team of the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/bringyourbrave" title="CDC - Bring Your Brave Campaign"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bring Your Brave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; educational campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Charity" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-charity-bring-your-brave.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 450px;" /&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the &lt;em&gt;Bring Your Brave&lt;/em&gt; campaign in 2015 to provide information about breast cancer to women younger than age 45. Our campaign tells real stories about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/young_women/bringyourbrave/stories/index.htm" title="CDC - Bring Your Brave - Women's Stories"&gt;nine young women&lt;/a&gt; whose lives have been affected by breast cancer. These stories about prevention, risk, family history, and survivorship bring to life the idea that young women can be personally affected by breast cancer. Through these testimonials, &lt;em&gt;Bring Your Brave&lt;/em&gt; aims to inspire young women to learn their risk for breast cancer, talk with their health care provider about their risk, and live a breast-healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States. About 1 in 8 women will get breast cancer during her life. Although most breast cancers are diagnosed in older women, in rare cases breast cancer does affect women under the age of 45. About 11% of all breast cancer cases in the United States are found in women younger than 45 years of age. Breast cancer in young women is more likely to be &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/young_women/bringyourbrave/hereditary_breast_cancer/index.htm" title="CDC - Bring Your Brave - Hereditary Breast Cancer and BRCA Genes"&gt;hereditary&lt;/a&gt; than breast cancer in older women and more likely to be found at a later stage, when it is often more aggressive and difficult to treat. Many young women do not know their risk for breast cancer or ways to manage their risk. We are working to close this knowledge gap for young women and health care providers and empower both in facing this disease.

  <title>How to Encourage Girls to Go After Their Dreams</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/encourage-girls-dream</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;How to Encourage Girls to Go After Their Dreams&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ed. note: For International Day of the Girl Child on October 11, 2018, OWH is cross-posting this piece from the Girls on the Run Blog. The original post date was November 7, 2016. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.girlsontherun.org/remarkable/281/How-to-Encourage-Girls-to-Go-After-Their-Dreams" title="How to Encourage Girls to Go After Their Dreams"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the original post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Image of two girls smiling." src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-gotr-dreams.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;We all want the girls in our lives to go after their dreams, but the media, our celebrity culture, and social media can send mixed messages that affect their confidence. Here are some tips to encourage your daughter, granddaughter, niece, younger sister, or any girl you know to have the confidence to work toward her goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a listening ear. &lt;/strong&gt;Ask what she would like to accomplish one day. Give her your undivided attention. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay open-minded.&lt;/strong&gt; Let her brainstorm and share her ideas, even if they seem unusual or out of reach to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help her set attainable goals.&lt;/strong&gt; While you never want to crush your girl's dreams, if a goal seems a bit too unrealistic right now, encourage her to set a related, short-term goal that's attainable in the next year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take action.&lt;/strong&gt; Offer to go for a run together after school, drive her to music lessons, or review her latest essay. Knowing you support her dreams can give her the confidence to keep pursuing them.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage her to visualize her goals.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether she prefers to journal her ideas in a notebook or create a vision board with magazine cutouts, a visual representation of her dreams can motivate her to reach them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinforce the importance of positive life skills&lt;/strong&gt;, such as hard work, persistence, a positive attitude, and responsibility. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be realistic about challenges.&lt;/strong&gt; Remind her that many dreams will not come easily, and hard work will foster a sense of accomplishment that increases her self-worth, even when she doesn't meet a particular goal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate her efforts, not just her achievements.&lt;/strong&gt; By focusing on how hard she worked rather than just her results, you will help her build confidence in her skills and her work ethic. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliment her talents.&lt;/strong&gt; Praise her excellent spelling, good listening skills, killer jump shot, or willingness to help those in need. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help her research her dream.&lt;/strong&gt; Spend time with her at the library or online researching how a person lands a particular job, or take her to meet with someone who has already met her particular goal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage her to set short-term goals to meet a long-term dream.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether that means learning to cook a meal for her family if she wants to become a chef or studying to earn excellent grades if she wants to attend a certain college, encourage her to take action today to meet her long-term goals. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask about the "why" behind her dreams.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a purpose behind her goals can help her stay motivated on the path to her dreams. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;How do you help the girl in your life stay positive and motivated to follow her dreams?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>I Can Do It! Mentorship Becomes a Lifelong Friendship</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/icdi-mentorship</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;I Can Do It! Mentorship Becomes a Lifelong Friendship&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/programs-and-awards/i-can-do-it/index.html" title="I Can Do It!"&gt;I Can Do It! (ICDI)&lt;/a&gt; is a customizable and inclusive health promotion model aimed at transforming the lives of individuals with a disability. The Office on Women’s Health and the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition have &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/icdi-model"&gt;partnered&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that women and girls with a disability have opportunities to be physically active and practice healthy eating behaviors through ICDI.&lt;/p&gt;
I became involved with ICDI several years ago as a Mentor and Support Team Member. As a Mentor, I helped individuals with a disability (Mentees) set weekly goals and participate in physical activity or healthy eating opportunities. Throughout my mentorship, I not only fostered social support — I also developed lasting friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Haley and Tori" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-icdi-haley-tori.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 343px;" /&gt;Fall 2009 was not only my first semester in college, but it was also when I signed up to volunteer for a program that used the ICDI model. That’s where I met the one and only Tori, my first ICDI Mentee! Little did I know that the decision to sign up as an ICDI Mentor would literally change the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
As an ICDI Mentee and Mentor, Tori and I began participating in aquatics and dance classes, but the fun had only just begun. Over the next 4 years, I grew more involved in ICDI and with Tori’s family. I watched Tori on the weekends, helped with birthday parties, and even joined for family vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
I accepted a job in the area after graduation, so even though I was no longer an ICDI Mentor, Tori and I continued to be friends. We went to Zumba 3 times a week, walked after school, and tried to think of a healthy food for each letter of the alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;
Tori and I are now 600 miles away, but that distance hasn’t changed a thing. Within the first year of my move, Tori came up with her family to visit me, and I flew down to visit her. On the day before I left, she wrote me a letter describing my visit:&lt;/p&gt;
 “… and I can’t believe that you are such a family in our lives … it was the best day and night, it was the best day of my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
After 9 years of friendship, my relationship with Tori is still very difficult to put into words. Not only is she like a sister to me, she is my best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

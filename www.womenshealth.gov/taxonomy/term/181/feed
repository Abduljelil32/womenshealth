  <description>&lt;span&gt;Sloane Stephens on Living Her Healthiest Life&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Taking steps for better health is not always easy. Professional athletes sometimes need a little extra motivation! As a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/nwhw"&gt;National Women’s Health Week ambassador&lt;/a&gt;, tennis champion Sloane Stephens shares how she builds healthy behaviors into her life. In this blog post, Sloane talks about getting motivated on tough days, making healthy food choices, and staying fit off the tennis court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What inspires you to be healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I want to be able to live a long life that includes being active, traveling, and keeping up with my family. Being my best and healthiest self allows me to enjoy the things that I love most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;On days when you are not feeling motivated, how do you help yourself get going?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Some days I wake up and I do not want to work out or play tennis. That is normal. I like to give myself little rewards for accomplishing those things when I need to. I tell myself, “OK, after practice I can go treat myself to some frozen yogurt or a movie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;When you are not playing tennis, what are your favorite ways to stay fit?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I enjoy gym workouts, beach walks, and the occasional spin or yoga class. I like to mix things up and challenge my body with new activities so that I do not get bored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Do you have any advice for making healthy food choices when you are traveling or dining out?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;It is all about balance. Choose healthy foods that make you feel good. There are definitely foods I know I have to avoid because I will be tired or feel bad after I eat them. Learning what works for your body and listening to it is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What is your favorite healthy snack?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Peanuts! I travel everywhere with a bag of them. They are easy to eat on the go, which is perfect for me since I travel a ton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What is your advice for making time for self-care, and how do you like to de-stress?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Again, I think it is important to listen to your body. If I had a long day or am just tired, I know not to push myself and make plans. I go home, take a bath, light candles, and just relax. Having no plans and just being with my family is the best way to really de-stress for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What are your go-to tips for getting good sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I am a big fan of diffusers. I like to use lavender to help me unwind and sleep well. Also, exercise helps me sleep. I noticed that I always sleep better when I get to work out that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Do you have advice on making your annual checkup with your doctor and actually keeping the appointment?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I like to keep all of my annual appointments at the same time every year. I schedule them when I know I will have some downtime so work or other commitments do not cause me to cancel or reschedule. Plus, it is easy to remember my appointments if they are all around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>6 Questions Answered: Seasonal Affective Disorder</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/seasonal-affective-disorder-spotlight</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;6 Questions Answered: Seasonal Affective Disorder&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Did you know the change in seasons can bring on a type of depression called seasonal affective disorder (SAD)? According to the National Institute of Mental Health, SAD is diagnosed &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/seasonal-affective-disorder/index.shtml#part_152432" title="NIMH Seasonal Affective Disorder"&gt;four times&lt;/a&gt; more often in women than men. To learn more about SAD and how women can manage it, we talked to Dr. Yael Nillni. She’s a clinical psychologist and assistant professor at the Boston University School of Medicine and the National Center for PTSD, Women’s Health Sciences Division. She talks about when to see a doctor, treatment options, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;January 31, 2019&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;How would you describe seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;SAD is essentially the same as major &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/depression/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, but it follows a seasonal pattern. It most commonly occurs during the fall and winter and goes away in the spring or summer. However, some people have different seasonal patterns, so SAD can happen during the summer, too. It’s just more common for people to experience it in the fall and winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What are the common symptoms of SAD?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Since SAD is essentially depression with a seasonal pattern, the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/depression/#5"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; are the same. During the winter months, many people experience a change in how they feel, such as a change in energy levels or eating habits. But these changes don’t significantly impact their lives the way SAD does. Someone experiencing SAD will usually start to hibernate — I think this is the best way to describe it. They withdraw and stop engaging in their lives by not doing things they typically enjoy and not seeing friends and family. Other classic symptoms of SAD are sleeping more, having low energy, and eating more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;When should women see their doctors?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Ask yourself if your symptoms are getting in the way of your day-to-day life. It’s common to have changes in mood or behavior during the winter, but if your symptoms are affecting your relationships or your ability to get things done, you should see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
If you’re having thoughts of hurting yourself, get help right away. If you’re in immediate danger, call 911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;How can women manage SAD?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;There are effective, evidence-based &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/seasonal-affective-disorder/index.shtml#part_152433" title="NIMH Seasonal Affective Disorder"&gt;treatments and therapies&lt;/a&gt;, and you can talk to your doctor, nurse, or mental health professional about your options. Some women will do one or a combination of these options.&lt;/p&gt;
I’ll start with light therapy, which includes sitting in front of a light box every morning to increase exposure to light. Typically, your doctor, nurse, or a mental health professional prescribes the light box. They tell you when you should sit in front of it and for how long. Then you’ll check in with them to see how it’s working and tweak the approach as necessary. Most people begin using the light box when their symptoms start, so in the fall, and use it daily until symptoms go away, so in the spring or summer.&lt;/p&gt;
There’s also cognitive behavioral therapy specific to SAD, which is a type of talk therapy that you can do with a mental health professional. Cognitive behavioral therapy targets thoughts and behaviors that may be getting in the way of feeling better. The cognitive part focuses on examining and challenging negative thoughts, and the behavioral part focuses on scheduling positive and pleasant activities. People often fall into a negative cycle, where they feel down, so they disengage and do less, which in turn makes them feel even more down and depressed. Challenging negative thoughts and scheduling activities you enjoy can help you kick out of this cycle and influence your mood in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
Your doctor, nurse, or mental health professional may also prescribe medication to help you manage SAD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Are there other daily habits you recommend that might help women cope with SAD?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I think if I could give one recommendation it’s to find activities you enjoy. It can be anything! Just choose something you can do throughout the year so you can continue to stay active in your life and not disengage when the seasons change. The key is to stay engaged by doing things you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
Additionally, know your warning signs. When you see and feel that you’re starting to pull back, that’s the time to act, whether that means using your light box, scheduling activities you like to do, or making an appointment with a mental health professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What’s one thing you wish all women knew about SAD?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Help is available! We have effective treatments for SAD that have been well-studied. You don’t have to suffer every winter. A lot of the people I see have been suffering with SAD for years, but they do get better with treatment. SAD affects a lot of people, and there’s nothing wrong with getting help. As mental health professionals, we have a set of skills that we can teach you to help you feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Being There for Mom: My Caregiving Journey</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/young-caregiver-story</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Being There for Mom: My Caregiving Journey&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;In 2011, my life was uprooted in an instant. I remember sitting on the floor of my Brooklyn, New York, apartment, heart pounding, tears flowing, palms sweating, anxiously anticipating a phone call where I hoped to hear two words: "She's OK."&lt;/p&gt;
Earlier that morning, my mom, who lived alone, was knocked unconscious after falling in her home in Tampa, Florida. A family friend found her about 12 hours later. While I waited for that phone call, I knew my life would never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Close up on young hands holding old hand." src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-young-caregiver.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;My mom has Parkinson's disease, and she'd been diagnosed about a year before her fall. Learning she had Parkinson's was scary, but her fall — the first serious health event since the diagnosis — created a new level of fear and uncertainty. It marked the beginning of my caregiving journey.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
At the beginning, I tried coordinating my mom's care from Brooklyn. It was difficult, but I'd always known this would happen eventually. I'm an only child, and my parents are divorced. It's just that I was only 29 at the time. I always imagined I'd become my mom's caregiver later in life when I had a partner and a family of my own to support me. My friends were great, but none of them were in a similar situation and just didn't get it.&lt;/p&gt;
I felt alone trying to deal with not just the stress, anxiety, and fear for my mom, but also her affairs. It became impossible to manage her care from a distance, so after 10 years of living in New York, I moved back to Florida. My mom needed me. Just like she had always been there for me, it was time for me to be there for her.&lt;/p&gt;
I'm still there for her, but caregiving isn't easy. It's physically, mentally, and emotionally draining. In addition to working full time, I manage my mom's finances, schedule her doctors' and therapy appointments, work with her aides and nurses, and visit her 3 to 4 days a week so she feels like she has a more "normal" life and strong mother/daughter relationship. It's a lot of work, but I'm fortunate that I don't also need to cover my mom's expenses. If I had to pay for her care, I would be telling a completely different story right now. &lt;/p&gt;
Since becoming a caregiver, I've started to learn more about other young caregivers who are between 20 and 34 and going through the same thing. According to AARP, on average, millennial caregivers spend more of their income (about 27%) on caregiving than older caregivers, while we — on average — have lower incomes than older caregivers. Additionally, while I don't represent the average caregiver (a woman who's almost 50 caring for a parent who's nearing 70), millennials make up 24% of the nation's unpaid caregivers. I'm part of a new, much younger generation of caregivers who are pushed into the role with smaller incomes, fewer options, and less support. As our numbers are expected to grow, so are the challenges. For millennial caregivers, it comes at a time in our lives when we're working toward expected milestones. So goals like settling into a career, getting married, starting a family, and buying a house often get derailed by our new role as caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;
I'm sharing my story because I want to raise awareness about the needs of millennial caregivers and ensure that they have the support they need so their lives aren't uprooted like mine. If you're a young caregiver, finding a community of support can help. And remember, take steps to care for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>What Women Say About Migraine</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/women-migraine</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;What Women Say About Migraine&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;What's a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/migraine"&gt;migraine&lt;/a&gt; headache like? Migraine headaches affect more women than men, and each woman who lives with this medical condition likely has a different answer to that question. Though they are not usually a threat to your overall health, migraine attacks can greatly affect your day-to-day life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Image of a woman looking down with hands on head" src="https://owh-wh-d9-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/blog-women-migraine.jpg" style="float: right; width: 450px; height: 300px;" /&gt;If you've never had one, a migraine headache is usually an intense, throbbing pain on one side or sometimes both sides of the head. Besides pain, women might experience nausea and vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound. Some people may also see spots or flashing lights (called an "aura") or lose their ability to see for a short time. The bottom line: Migraine headaches can be quite severe and disabling.&lt;/p&gt;
To better understand what migraine attacks can be like for women, we interviewed three women about their personal experiences. See what Noelle, Mary, and Katie* have to say about migraine triggers, living with migraine, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don't know the exact cause of migraine headaches, but experts do know that people with migraine react to a variety of factors and events, called triggers. Here's what Noelle has to say about triggers she experiences:&lt;/strong&gt; "A big trigger for me is a change in the weather, which I unfortunately can't control. My doctor suggested a food diary. I didn't find it that helpful because I don't eat the same things often enough. But I did learn to avoid peanut butter and MSG because they seem more likely to trigger a migraine attack for me." Learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/migraine#3"&gt;migraine triggers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many forms of migraine headaches. The two forms seen most often are migraine with aura and migraine without aura. Migraine with aura affects the senses. Noelle explains: &lt;/strong&gt;"I remember the first time I had a one — I was terrified. I thought I was going blind. When one hits, I suddenly have trouble focusing my eyes. If I'm reading, the letters no longer appear sharp — there's a blur to everything. That's my first clue. Then the aura starts. It's this tiny circle, generally in my left field of vision. It's small at first, but then it gets bigger and bigger until it's a zigzag line, like little mountains going across my line of vision. It's bright, and it flashes, which makes me feel sick to my stomach. Generally, my aura lasts for about 15 minutes. Then the headache kicks in, which can last for several hours or a full day." Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/migraine#4"&gt;different types of migraine headaches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women can work with their doctor or nurse to make a plan for managing migraine attacks. You can also take steps at home, like taking medicine your doctor or nurse has prescribed for migraine headaches, drinking fluids, and resting in a dark, quiet room. Mary shares how she deals with a migraine attack:&lt;/strong&gt; "I usually feel extreme pressure on my forehead, so I manage the pain with over-the-counter pain medicine. Ideally, I'm then able to go to a dark room where I can lie down and put a cold compress over my eyes. But I don't always have that luxury. I'm often at work or with my kids, so I take my meds and hope for the best. Sometimes, I'll drink a soda for the caffeine, a recommendation from one of my doctors that helps me. But there are times when my migraine headaches are so debilitating that I can't just power through. I have to stop working or I put on a TV show for the kids so that I can shut down for a little while." Learn ways to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/migraine#19"&gt;manage migraine attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="4"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compared with migraine headaches, tension-type headaches are generally less severe and rarely disabling. Mary explains how she tells the difference: &lt;/strong&gt;"The severity tells me whether it's a migraine or a tension headache. I can tell from how I feel afterward, too. I get what I call a "migraine hangover." You don't fully feel like yourself. Nothing hurts, but it's like you're recovering from something. Once the headache is gone, it still takes me awhile to get back to 100%." Learn &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/migraine#5"&gt;how to tell if you're having a migraine headache&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migraine has no cure. But migraine headaches can be managed with help from your doctor or nurse. Katie explains how she treats her migraine symptoms when they start: &lt;/strong&gt;"I've been getting migraine headaches since I was 8 or 9, but I didn't start getting them frequently until I got older. I started a prescription to help with the pain in my 20s, but it made me feel nauseous and on edge. I worked with my doctor to find a better option for me, and for the past 8 years, I've been taking a prescription medicine that stops the pain before it starts when I'm experiencing a migraine attack. I'm more comfortable knowing I have this prescription. It makes me feel like an attack won't get in the way of my normal life."

  <title>Healthy Cooking Tips Around the Holidays</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/healthy-holiday-cooking-tips</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Healthy Cooking Tips Around the Holidays&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;The holidays often bring delicious meals and treats, and it can be tough to eat healthy with so much good food around. Rather than skipping or cutting out your favorite dishes, why not try making a few small changes to your recipes to cook up healthier versions? We talked to Anjali Shah, a food blogger who runs &lt;a href="https://pickyeaterblog.com/" title="The Picky Eater - A Healthy Food Blog"&gt;The Picky Eater&lt;/a&gt;. She wants to make healthy eating easy and fun. See her ideas and simple tricks for healthier cooking this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;November 27, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;When it comes to favorite family recipes, do you have any tricks for swapping in healthier ingredients?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Yes! I’ll start with an easy one — I always choose whole grains instead of white grains. So, I use whole-wheat pasta (or, alternatively, lentil pasta), brown rice instead of white rice, and whole-wheat bread instead of white bread.&lt;/p&gt;
Another thing I like to do is cut back on the cream that’s in so many holiday recipes. If I’m making a cream-based soup, I take white beans and blend them with chicken or vegetable stock. Then I add a splash of cream to it. It still makes a nice, creamy soup, but it’s not as heavy. Plus, beans are a good source of protein. &lt;/p&gt;
I also like to cut the amount of oil and butter in recipes in half. The dish still tastes really good, but it’s a little lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
My last swap is for recipes with a lot of sugar. Think about a sweet potato casserole. Sweet potatoes and some of the other ingredients are sweet on their own. I rely on their sweetness and think of sugar as an enhancer, so I use half the amount listed in the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Do you have go-to ways to work more fruits and vegetables into meals?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I like to look at a recipe and think about the colors in it. For example, mac and cheese: What are the colors? White and yellow. That’s kind of limiting if I want to build a colorful plate, so I think about the other colors I can add to it. Then, I choose the vegetables that represent those colors. In mac and cheese, I think green and orange would be nice. For orange, try pureeing butternut squash and stirring it into the dish. It’s the same with something like oatmeal. It’s white, so what other pops of color can be added? My go-to choices are berries and stone fruits like peaches, cherries, and plums.&lt;/p&gt;
For people who don’t love vegetables, pureeing different veggies is a great way to make a more wholesome dish and add important nutrients. Pureed cauliflower, which has a mild flavor, can be added to anything while helping you squeeze in more veggies. If you’re making a soup, add pureed spinach. It takes on the taste of whatever else is in the soup but packs in nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
For people who do like veggies, add a side salad to most meals or a side dish of roasted, stir-fried, or sautéed veggies with spices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;For women looking to cut back on salt, what are some alternatives they can use to season their food?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;If you can handle a little bit of spice, I like crushed red pepper or black pepper. I also like ginger and garlic. I think these help boost the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;It’s hard to imagine the holidays without dessert. Do you have tips for making sweet treats healthier? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Basically, you have to decide how healthy you want to go. There are tons of ways to make things healthier, but I see it as a spectrum. It’s as simple as saying you’re going to cut the sugar by a quarter or half. It’s not a huge change, but it means less sugar. When I reduce the sugar, I often add in vanilla, cinnamon, or nutmeg for flavor. On the other end, I sub in whole-wheat pastry flour for all-purpose flour. My baked goods are still fluffy, but again, I’m using a whole grain instead of a white grain. Another great substitute is Greek yogurt for sour cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Do you have any secrets for making healthier kid-friendly meals?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;For kids, it depends on how picky they are, but I like to start by serving a variety of vegetables and fruits with all meals. It’s good exposure. One trick I’ve found that works is to ask kids to eat the number of bites that equals their age. If they’re 5, that means 5 bites of whatever vegetable you’re serving that night.&lt;/p&gt;
For kids who will only eat bread, cheese, and pasta, pureeing fruits and vegetables is a great way to get them into more meals. At breakfast time, make pancakes with whole-grain flour and top them with apple sauce or pureed pears with mashed bananas. For lunch, make a grilled cheese on wheat bread instead of white bread. As a side, try a tomato soup, and you can add in pureed veggies like spinach or cauliflower that they won’t even notice! For dinner, try a quesadilla on whole-wheat tortillas with veggies and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;When you’re grocery shopping, do you have tips for choosing healthy options?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;If I’m buying a premade soup or broth — or anything premade — I choose the low-sodium options. If I need vegetables but need them to last longer, I buy frozen ones. But my favorite tip is to stick to the perimeter of the store. That’s usually where the fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, and protein foods like meat are sold. The middle of the store tends to have more packaged and processed foods that can be less nutritious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What’s your best advice for making cooking around the holidays less stressful? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;It might still be stressful, but trying to plan in advance can be helpful — and not just during the holidays, but year-round, too. Plan the meal or meals on one day, grocery shop for everything you need on another day, and then do the meal prep ahead of time so that things are ready to go when it’s time to start cooking. If you have family around, split up the responsibilities or get them involved so that it goes faster and is more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>An Interview About Suicide Prevention</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/spotlight-suicide-prevention</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;An Interview About Suicide Prevention&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content warning: Suicide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Suicide is a serious problem, and the rate of suicide among women is on the rise. People who consider suicide often feel like there is no hope, and they may often feel trapped or alone. We spoke with Dr. Danielle Johnson, Chief of Adult Psychiatry and Director of the Women’s Mental Health Program at Lindner Center of HOPE, to discuss suicide and what women should do if they’re having suicidal thoughts. She also talks about risk factors, warning signs, and how to support loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;September 28, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What are some common mental health conditions that affect women?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Among women, mood disorders and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders"&gt;anxiety disorders&lt;/a&gt; are definitely the most common. Mood disorders include conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/depression"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/bipolar-disorder-manic-depressive-illness"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;. As for anxiety disorders, examples include generalized anxiety disorder, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder"&gt;post-traumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and social anxiety disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;When should women consider getting help to manage mental health conditions?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;If you’re having trouble meeting the demands of daily life, I would encourage you to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/get-help-now"&gt;seek help&lt;/a&gt;. How do you know if your symptoms are affecting your daily life? Consider these questions: Do you have trouble getting up? Are you getting to work late? Are you having difficulty sleeping? Are you eating enough and choosing healthy foods?&lt;/p&gt;
Women are used to having so many obligations that they might not want to take the time to recognize that something is going on. Sometimes, someone else has to point it out to them. But if you feel like something isn’t quite right, it’s OK to ask for help. Unfortunately, the stigma still exists, and women might think they need to just push through it. Getting treatment can help you feel better and make it easier to meet the expectations of your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Do you have advice for women who feel unsure about asking for help?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Yes. Let’s recognize that a mental health issue is a &lt;em&gt;health&lt;/em&gt; issue, just like high blood pressure or diabetes. If you had diabetes, you would get treatment. The same should apply for mental health — there are things that can be done to help you manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
Also, I try to get people to think about what they would say to a family member or friend. You would tell them to get help, so why not do the same for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What should women do if they’re having suicidal thoughts?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Tell someone. Talk to a friend or a family member, or share your feelings with a mental health professional. If you’re not getting mental health treatment, tell your primary care provider. &lt;a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" title="Lifeline"&gt;Call or text a crisis hotline.&lt;/a&gt; People want to help you, and you can feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
If you’re in immediate danger, call 911 or go to an emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;
I also want to point out that passive thoughts about suicide are still concerning. By passive thoughts, I mean thinking things like, “If I don’t wake up tomorrow, that would be OK,” or “If I get into a car accident, that would be OK.” These thoughts are still concerning and should be taken seriously. You don’t have to feel like this. With help, you can feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Are there warning signs for suicide?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Yes. Some behaviors to look for include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making plans to not be here anymore, such as talking about who would take care of the kids or who would get certain things or possessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talking about wanting to die or feeling hopeless, trapped, or like a burden to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking for ways to commit suicide, such as searching online or stockpiling pills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engaging in reckless behavior, like driving faster than is safe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using alcohol or drugs more often&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdrawing from activities and people, such as not returning phone calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleeping too little or too much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Displaying extreme mood swings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acting anxious or agitated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;Read about &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/get-help-now/suicide-prevention#3"&gt;additional warning signs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What can women do if they think someone they know is considering suicide?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;There’s a misconception that if you talk to people about suicide, you’ll increase their risk of suicide, but that’s not the case. Talk to them. You can say, “I’m worried about you. What can I do to help? Are you safe?” This lets them know that they have someone who cares and is there to listen and talk.&lt;/p&gt;
If someone is in treatment, you can encourage them to talk about how they’re feeling with a mental health professional. If they’re not, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/get-help-now/getting-treatment#1"&gt;offer to help them get help&lt;/a&gt;. You can make phone calls to find a health professional or places where they can get treatment, as this task can often feel overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;
If someone is in immediate danger, call 911 or take them to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;
Read about other ways you can &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/get-help-now/suicide-prevention#2"&gt;help someone who is having suicidal thoughts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What else besides mental health conditions can put women at risk of suicide?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Some risk factors for suicide can include history of trauma, whether it’s sexual, verbal, or emotional; misuse of drugs or alcohol; and prolonged stress or stressful situations, such as the loss of a loved one or job, financial problems, or harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
Read about &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/get-help-now/suicide-prevention#4"&gt;additional risk factors for suicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Are there any myths about suicide that are harmful to women?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Women aren’t always taken as seriously when they express their feelings. Instead, women may be viewed as dramatic or attention-seeking. But the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db309.htm" title="Products - Data Briefs - Number 309 - June 2018"&gt;rate of suicide among women&lt;/a&gt; increased by 50% from 2000 through 2016. So, I urge you to take all mental health concerns seriously and make sure you (and the women in your life) get the help you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Is there a final thought you’d like to share? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Part of the reason that women are so affected by mood disorders and anxiety disorders is due to hormonal changes throughout the course of their lives, such as puberty, pregnancy, and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
One in 9 new mothers has &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/postpartum-depression"&gt;postpartum depression&lt;/a&gt;, a serious mental health issue that, if left untreated, can increase a woman’s risk of attempting suicide. If a woman in your life recently gave birth, make sure she’s going to her follow-up appointments and watch for any behavioral changes or warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Q&amp;A With a Sickle Cell Disease Expert</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/sickle-cell-disease-spotlight</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Q&amp;A With a Sickle Cell Disease Expert&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;This National Sickle Cell Awareness Month, we spoke with Dr. Nirmish Shah, the Director of the Sickle Cell Transition Program at Duke University. He shares some &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/sickle-cell-disease"&gt;sickle cell disease&lt;/a&gt; basics and talks about his research aimed at helping patients manage sickle cell disease. See how he’s using technology to improve care for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What is sickle cell disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Sickle cell disease is a lifelong disease that runs in families, affecting as many as 100,000 people in the United States. It is caused by an abnormality in hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body), which causes the red blood cells to be sickle-shaped instead of round. People with sickle cell disease also have fewer red blood cells, and over time, blocked blood flow and lack of oxygen can cause serious health problems and organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;
The most common complication and cause for being admitted to the hospital for sickle cell disease is pain. Pain is caused by a decrease in blood flow to bones. Many pain crises occur quickly and without warning. Other &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/sickle-cell-disease#13"&gt;significant complications&lt;/a&gt; include stroke, acute chest syndrome, and kidney problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What does life with sickle cell disease look like?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Everyone is different. We don’t know who will have &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/sickle-cell-disease#13"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt; from sickle cell disease, so we watch everyone closely. During childhood, which is when most people have problems, we work on preventing infections, screening for complications, and managing any problems that happen. Children and adolescents don’t often have episodes of intense pain, but the risk of pain episodes and other problems increases with age. For adults with sickle cell disease, we focus more on managing or preventing these pain episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Will you tell us about your work to help people living with sickle cell disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;As Director of Duke University’s Sickle Cell Transition Program, my team’s research focuses on treating children and adults with sickle cell disease. When I work with children, I try to teach them about their condition and how to transition successfully to living with the disease as an adult. For all of my patients, I focus on giving the medical, social, mental, and emotional support they need to be healthier. My research aims to test new medicines for sickle cell disease and use new technologies to improve care for patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Why is it important to you to pursue this research?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;In the past, we have not had many options for treating sickle cell disease. Today, treatments can lessen complications, but they do not get rid of them completely. We are testing newer medicines that I hope can give people more options when other treatments don’t help. Also, chronic diseases such as sickle cell disease are difficult to keep an eye on and manage. I have been creating mobile applications that patients can use to record their symptoms and treatments. These apps also let health professionals remotely monitor and communicate with patients. I have also been using wearable technology (similar to a fitness tracker) to measure how well my patients are moving. This helps us better understand how pain impacts their disease. All of this research and technology is so important to helping us offer more treatments and help monitor and manage sickle cell disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What do you hope your work will accomplish?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;We need innovative ideas to improve care for chronic diseases, such as sickle cell disease. Since most people have smartphones and access to technology, I have been working hard to use mobile apps, wearable devices, and virtual reality to improve medical care. I believe that all of this technology will soon become the norm in helping patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What insights can you share with us? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;First, patients are very interested in using technology, such as mobile apps, but people use technology less often when they are feeling really well and when they are feeling really bad. This is not surprising, but it is important to understand when managing patients. Second, we learned that patients who texted with their health care providers were much less likely to go to the emergency room and hospital. The patients were much better at managing their disease. Finally, we learned that we can use wearable devices to measure activity and heart rate and predict pain. The data from a wearable device could tell us how much pain a patient was experiencing with 70% accuracy. I am very excited that all of this technology is quickly developing, and I believe we will be able to use it to improve the health of people with sickle cell disease in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>A New Mom’s Breastfeeding Story</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/spotlight-breastfeeding-month</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;A New Mom’s Breastfeeding Story&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Thinking about breastfeeding? Hear from a new mom who made the decision to go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
Meet Danielle Cunningham. She’s a first-time mom who opened up about her breastfeeding journey in honor of National Breastfeeding Month and Black Breastfeeding Week. Danielle shares why she chose to breastfeed, what her first few weeks were like, and how her family has supported her decision. Plus, she explains what’s surprised her most about breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;August 29, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Why did you decide to breastfeed?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I decided to breastfeed for the health benefits — not just for me, but for my baby boy, too. I know that breastfeeding gives my growing baby the nutrients he needs at this delicate age. Another great thing that I like about breastfeeding is that it helps us save money. And one of the best parts about breastfeeding is the bonding time for my baby and me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;How long have you been breastfeeding your baby, and what’s your breastfeeding goal?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I have been breastfeeding for 3 months, and I have 3 more months to go. Before I had him, I was confident that I wanted to breastfeed for 6 months, but now, my view has changed. I may continue to breastfeed after we hit the 6-month mark, but right now my goal is at least 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What were those first few weeks of breastfeeding like for you? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;My first week of breastfeeding seemed easy enough. But once the second week came around — that was a different story. It was absolutely painful for about 2 weeks. I remember feeling unexcited about feeding time, even though my baby was excited. The latch was really uncomfortable, but fortunately, I didn’t have to worry that he wasn’t getting enough food. He went from 8 pounds (his birth weight) to 13 pounds in 4 weeks. While it was tough on me at times, I at no point decided to call it quits. I knew it would get better with time, and it did. By the time his first-month checkup came around, feeding became easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What did you do to work on your baby’s latch?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Honestly, I didn't do much to improve his latch. We just kept on breastfeeding, and with time, we both got the hang of it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Once your baby’s latch improved, what has breastfeeding been like for you?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Breastfeeding is beautiful. You read and hear about it, but the bond is more than I imagined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Do you take any steps to prepare before you breastfeed?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Before I breastfeed, I make sure the feeding area is clean and that I have a pillow to prop my arm on so that I’m comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Have your family members or friends played a role in your breastfeeding journey?  &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Definitely. Because I'm breastfeeding and working, I have to pump throughout the day. My family has been very supportive of my choice to strictly breastfeed. My mom has been an angel during this process. For my shower gift, she got me a breast pump and a lot of bags so I could store my milk. This was the best gift! My active babysitters (my baby’s grandparents) are willing to store my breastmilk in their freezer so they always have some available. I’m so grateful for their support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Has anything else surprised you about breastfeeding?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Yes! For me, the surprising thing about breastfeeding is that my body is on a schedule to produce milk. Even when I'm away from him, I know when it's time for him to eat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What’s been the key to success during your breastfeeding journey?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;To successfully breastfeed, I have to be comfortable. When I breastfeed, I grab my supportive pillow and I’m in my favorite room in the house. If I’m out, that means I have something to cover my son so I feel less vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
It’s also important for me to stay hydrated. I’ve found that when I’m properly hydrated, I produce the most milk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Do you have advice for pregnant women who are thinking about breastfeeding?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;My advice is to go for it. Building trust with your newborn is the best feeling in the world. As a mother, this is something that only you can provide for your growing baby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>An Interview About Veteran Women’s Health</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/spotlight-veteran-women</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;An Interview About Veteran Women’s Health&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Coming up on August 27, 2018, the National Meeting on Active Duty and Veteran Women’s Health will bring together health professionals and researchers to discuss the specialized health care needs of active duty and veteran women. In preparation for the meeting, Dr. Sally Haskell of the Veterans Health Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), joins us on the OWH Blog. She discusses the unique risks and exposures that women veterans face that can impact their health and health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;August 24, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What is your current role at the VA?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I’m currently the Deputy Chief Consultant and National Director of Comprehensive Women’s Health for the Office of Women’s Health Services in the Veterans Health Administration, part of the VA. I’ve been with the VA for 26 years. I’m a General Internal Medicine doctor by background, and I still have an active practice, seeing women veterans one half day a week in the West Haven, Connecticut VA Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;In your time at the VA, what kind of progress have you seen in our understanding of veteran women’s health?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I’ve been working in VA health care for 26 years, and I’ve been working with women veterans for at least 20 years. The population of women veterans using VA services has tripled over that time period, so we now have over 700,000 women enrolled for VA care. Initially women veterans were considered a special population in VA, and at many sites, women’s health services weren’t readily available. That has all changed dramatically with the implementation of comprehensive women’s health care across our system in the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
We now have designated women’s health primary care providers and women’s mental health champions in all VA health care systems. We provide full gynecology services (196 gynecologists across the system) and mammography and breast cancer treatments either on-site or in the community (60 sites have on-site mammography). Women veterans are also eligible for maternity care and delivery services that are covered by VA and provided through community care.&lt;/p&gt;
Over the last ten years, we have expanded our understanding of the effects of military service on women’s lives and women veterans’ health care needs. Women veterans (especially those using the VA system) have been increasingly understood as a very resilient population, but a population that is/has been at risk of physical and mental trauma. As in the general population, some patients in the VA are very healthy, but others suffer from complex mental and physical co-morbidities. The most prevalent conditions we see in the VA among women veterans using VA care are musculoskeletal conditions, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health" title="Mental Health | womenshealth.gov"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke" title="Heart Disease and Stroke | womenshealth.gov"&gt;cardiovascular conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What makes veteran women’s health unique?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Women veterans’ health is not unique, but as a population, women veterans may have had some unique experiences and exposures. These include very positive aspects such as readiness, fitness, and resilience as well as the many skills they’ve acquired during their military service. In addition, there can be negative consequences such as exposure to occupational hazards and trauma. We have to keep all of these risks and exposures in mind as we provide care. As health professionals, we must screen for things like traumatic brain injury, sexual trauma, and the mental health consequences of trauma exposure, including &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/mental-health-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder" title="Post-traumatic stress disorder | womenshealth.gov"&gt;post-traumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt; (PTSD). We must also be mindful of the possibility of musculoskeletal injuries, often from chronic wear and tear on women’s joints, and risk for chronic pain syndromes. In terms of reproductive health, research shows that PTSD can increase rates of pre-term delivery, so it is especially important for OB-GYN providers to be aware of military service.&lt;/p&gt;
The time of leaving the military and transitioning to civilian life can bring additional challenges to women veterans who are sometimes lacking social support, feeling a lack of recognition for their service, and dealing with family stresses.&lt;/p&gt;
Finally, in terms of cardiovascular health, we know that men and women veterans are usually in good shape when they leave the military because of physical fitness and weight requirements, but it is easy to let health habits slip. We see a lot of weight gain and development of cardiovascular risk factors after veterans leave service and enter VA care. It is important for health professionals to talk with their patients about these risks and the lifestyle changes needed to prevent heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;Why is it important for health professionals to understand the issues veteran women face?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;A lot of women veterans get their medical care from community health professionals. These health professionals may not think to ask about whether a woman has served in the military, and because of that, they may not screen for the experiences and exposures that I’ve discussed above. By screening and identifying issues early, health professionals can engage women veterans in treatment and prevention and connect them with VA resources as needed. Also, having experienced trauma can impact the way a woman responds to or engages in health care experiences, so it is important for health professionals to ask women about trauma history and to practice with this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What tools do health professionals need to better care for women veterans?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I think it is important for health professionals to know how to take a military history, which includes asking if women served in the military, their location of service, and military occupation. They should be aware of screening for combat and sexual trauma, depression, and PTSD. Knowledge of principles of pain management, including pain self-management, and trauma-informed care are particularly important. Health professionals should also be aware of the services that VA provides for women veterans and know how to help veterans get enrolled and utilize VA benefits and services. Knowledge of important numbers like the Women Veteran Call Center (1-855-829-6636), the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255), and the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans (1-877-424-3838) would also be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;Will you tell us about the National Meeting on Active Duty and Veteran Women’s Health?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/live/live-1/index.html#9096" title="National Meeting on Active Duty and Veteran Women's Health event page"&gt;National Meeting on Active Duty and Veteran Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; is an important collaboration between the Office on Women’s Health, the VA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the U.S. Department of Defense. It brings together clinical and behavioral health professionals and researchers for a full day of presentations on active duty service women and women veterans’ health issues with a goal of educating health professionals about the health effects of military service and VA resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What do you hope health professionals will gain from the meeting?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;I hope that health professionals will go back to their practices with a recognition and respect for women veterans and be aware of common health conditions in women veterans and the unique risks and exposures that women veterans face that can impact their health and health care. I hope that this meeting will change their practices so that they always ask their patients if they’ve served in the military.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Q&amp;A With an Infertility Expert</title>
  <link>https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/infertility-spotlight</link>
  <description>&lt;span&gt;Q&amp;A With an Infertility Expert&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;Infertility is a common problem, and anyone can face infertility challenges. To uncover answers to common infertility questions, we spoke with Dr. Esther Eisenberg, director of the Reproductive Medicine and Infertility Program at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. She shares the basics of infertility, including what it means and when to see a doctor. She also shares her advice on how to cope with infertility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anonymous (not verified)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;June 12, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="qa-wrapper"&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What's the most common question you get about infertility? &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Women often ask, “What is infertility?” I tell them that infertility means not being able to get pregnant after one year of trying. I also think it’s important to let women know that infertility is not uncommon, and millions of women have trouble getting pregnant and staying pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;When should a woman see her doctor about infertility testing?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Generally, a woman should talk to her doctor about infertility testing after one year of trying to become pregnant without success or if she has conceived but has had two or more miscarriages. Because the risk of infertility increases as a woman gets older, if she’s over 35, she should consider having infertility testing after six months of trying to become pregnant without success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What should she know about infertility testing?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Infertility can result from problems in a woman, a man, or a couple. For women, the tests aim to answer the following questions: Does she have eggs? Are her eggs released from the ovary every month (a process that we call ovulation)? Are the fallopian tubes open to allow the egg to travel from the ovary to the uterus? Does she have a uterus, and are there any structural problems with her uterus? Are her hormones, such as her thyroid hormone, normal?&lt;/p&gt;
For men, the tests will determine the following: Does he produce sperm? Do the sperm move forward and are there enough?&lt;/p&gt;
Infertility tests look for problems that we know about, but some couples have unexplained infertility. That means that after doing all the standard infertility tests, we cannot find a problem and we do not understand why the couple is not getting pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What’s your advice for a woman who just found out she has fertility problems?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;If a woman finds out that she has a fertility problem, it would be wise to talk to a doctor, even if she is not ready to become pregnant immediately. Perhaps there are steps she can take to improve her fertility in the future. If she is ready to conceive, then she may be tested to see if she has a specific problem that can be treated. However, the outlook is bright! There are many &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/infertility#11"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; that have been developed that will increase a woman’s chances of becoming pregnant and giving birth to a healthy baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What questions should a woman ask her doctor about treatment options?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Once a woman learns what is causing infertility, she might ask about treatment options, the success rate of each option, and how long it will take to become pregnant. It may be helpful for a couple to develop a treatment plan that covers four to six months because most patients do not become pregnant during the first cycle in which they are treated. If your doctor is not familiar with various infertility treatments, it may be useful to work with a reproductive endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in infertility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;What’s the biggest myth surrounding infertility?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;There are many myths surrounding infertility. It is important to know how the menstrual cycle works and what steps are part of the process to get pregnant. I encourage women to learn what &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/infertility#7"&gt;external factors can affect fertility&lt;/a&gt;, such as what you eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="qa-container"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--blog-qa paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
    &lt;h2&gt;How can women support other women who are dealing with infertility issues?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class="answer"&gt;Women can support other women by talking to each other and sharing resources about infertility rather than dealing with infertility alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
